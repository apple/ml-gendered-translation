10363	So the [[Council's]] compromise is inadequate in every way, and [[we]] assume that there will be more change in this area.	Amb,Amb
10364	In this respect, [[I]] welcome the recent proposal by the Spanish [[Presidency]] to set up a permanent forum specifically for these regions.	Amb,Amb
10365	Council Directive 72/462 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine, ovine and caprine [[animals]] and [[swine]], fresh meat or meat products from third countries, does not apply to meat that forms part of the personal luggage of those [[tourists]], insofar as it does not exceed 1 kg., belongs to the bovine or swine species, is fresh meat and is for personal consumption.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10366	The first point [[I]] would like to make - and this has been alluded to by my friend and colleague, Mr [[Cushnahan]] - is that Hong Kong cannot pass law under its constitution if it contravenes the international standards of human rights.	Amb,Male
10367	B5-0044/2003 by Mrs [[Sanders-ten Holte]], Mr [[Sánchez García]] and Mr [[Gasòliba i Böhm]], on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party: the human rights situation in Equatorial Guinea;	Female,Male,Male
10368	[[Anyone]] who immerses himself in this problem cannot escape the conclusion that very few statistics exist that are comparable.	Male
10369	[[We]] have seen already other pieces of legislation come before this House, for one of which I was the [[rapporteur]], which were part of the jigsaw creating the total picture of control over genetically modified organisms.	Amb,Amb
10370	What [[athlete]] would knowingly cause damage to his heart or liver, his kidneys or reproductive organs?	Male
10371	This is where it seems to [[me]] to be essential that [[we]] should safeguard the collegial nature of the [[Commission]], which would be put under strain if [[Parliament]] were to approve [[Commissioners]] on an individual basis.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10372	An example of one such incident is the position recently adopted by Mr [[Schröder]], the former German chancellor, on the construction of the gas pipeline along the bottom of the Baltic Sea.	Male
10373	As [[Montesquieu]] said – in the best possible way – and [[I]] shall say it in French:	Amb,Amb
10374	Latvian [[citizens]] and [[non-citizens]] know this problem from their own negative experience since many of [[us]], especially Russian [[speakers]], mainly go to Russia in order to visit our [[relatives]] and [[friends]] living there.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10375	Statistics on female [[prisoners]] suggest a generally low level of education and a lack of vocational skills.	Female
10376	It is obvious that there can be no development if there is no ownership, as Mr [[Hutchinson]] and Mrs [[Morgantini]] were saying.	Male,Female
10377	[[I]] firmly believe that a [[politician]] who acts on the basis of her personal experience of motherhood and [[family]] life will best understand [[women's]] problems.	Amb,Female,Amb,Female
10378	[[I]] would like to express my respect and gratitude to all the [[professionals]] and [[volunteers]] who have contributed to the rescue and reconstruction effort in the affected areas, and I would like to express my particular condolences to the [[families]] of the [[victims]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10379	The [[Member]] is accused of defamation allegedly committed as a result of statements made about the accuser, a Hungarian citizen, in the course of a radio programme broadcast on 25 March 2010, to which he was invited in his capacity as a politician and a Member of the European Parliament.	Male
10380	Thank you, [[Commissioner]], for the detailed answer.	Amb
10381	This attack marked the severance of their previous alliance and the secret [[Hitler]]-[[Stalin]] pact of August 1939, which divided up Europe.	Amb,Amb
10382	To the contrary, [[we]] have a duty to support - as does the rapporteur Mr [[von Habsburg]], whom we thank - we have a duty to support the Kingdom of Morocco and do everything we can to help it, because it is still a bastion against the rise of the [[extremists]], extremists on the very borders of Morocco who, for their part, have not the least concept of the most basic of all human rights - respect for life.	Amb,Male,Amb
10383	Let [[me]] conclude by warmly thanking the Irish presidency for the courtesy it has extended to the [[Groups]] of this Parliament and to Parliament itself and for taking on board the concerns of this Parliament.	Amb,Amb
10384	Needless to say, [[Commissioner]], [[I]] should not wish the electronic component to be found by the [[customer]] when he carves his Sunday joint at the lunch table, so the question of a sensible niche for the microchip, based on practical experience, will certainly have to be discussed somewhat sooner.	Amb,Amb,Male
10385	Madam [[President]], regarding the Minutes, it is the point [[I]] raised yesterday which was also raised by Mrs [[Ewing]] and Mr [[Tomlinson]] about the demonstration.	Female,Amb,Female,Male
10386	Between 200 to 300 [[demonstrators]] are reported to have been deported to other EU countries and there have been numerous reports of protestors being manhandled by [[police]], including reports of [[women]] being subjected to body searches and accompanied to toilets by male police [[officers]].	Amb,Amb,Female,Male
10387	[[We]] must make sure that the weakest [[employees]], such as [[women]], do not become the losers on the future labour market.	Amb,Amb,Female
10388	Mr [[President]], Mr [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], since all of us here are experts [[I]] shall, in view of the late hour make just two basic comments on the Le Rachinel report on the type-approval of vehicles and on the report of my colleague, [[Camisón Asensio]], on transportable pressure equipment.	Male,Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
10389	Mr [[President]], [[we]] would like to thank our untiring colleague, Mrs [[Fontaine]], and the [[Committee]] on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media for their excellent, fast work.	Male,Amb,Female,Amb

10456	Many are of cheesecake [[models]] (guradoru), or porn [[starlets]] (nūdoru); others are of [[singers]], television [[personalities]], professional [[sportswomen]] (often wrestlers) and so forth.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
10457	In a 1993 telephone interview with Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, [[Page]] told host [[Robin Leach]] that she had been unaware of the resurgence of her popularity, stating that she was "penniless and infamous".	Female,Amb

10459	The first fifteen years of her career were frustrating, [[she]] was only given small parts, but she attracted growing attention in the late 1940s, and by the end of her career was recognised as one of the most respected [[singers]] of her generation.	Female,Amb
10460	In 2004, [[he]] returned to the UK Top 10 for the first time as a solo [[artist]] since 1973, with the [[George Benson]]-sampling "Breeze On By", co-written with former teen idol [[Gary]] [[Barlow]], from the 1990s UK boy band [[Take That]], reaching number 8.	Male,Male,Amb,Male,Amb,Male

10467	[[He]] recalled his [[publisher's]] explaining why he thought the diary has been so widely read, with the comment, "he said that the diary encompasses so many areas of life that each [[reader]] can find something that moves him personally".	Male,Male,Male

10471	The dispute ended with the death of [[Victor II]] without male [[heirs]] on 22 April 1812, who left [[Frederick]] as the only living agnate of the branch and, in consequence, heir to the principality.	Amb,Male,Amb

10474	Soon afterwards the [[commander]] of the Infantry School also received a telegram from his new [[commander]] informing him of the current political situation.	Male,Amb
10475	During [[Dunama's]] reign, he had declared that all the [[sons]] of his [[predecessor]] should be killed, and [[Aissa's]] five-year-old half-brother [[Idris]] was therefore sent away to Bulala in secret by his [[mother]].	Male,Male,Amb,Amb,Male,Female

10491	After describing how the [[performers]] were hidden behind metal grilles, [[he]] related in his Confessions (1770): [[I]] have not an idea of anything so voluptuous and affecting as this music; the richness of the art, the exquisite taste of the vocal part, the excellence of the voices, the justness of the execution, everything in these delightful concerts concurs to produce an impression which certainly is not the mode, but from which I am of opinion no heart is secure.	Amb,Male,Male
10492	Most of the [[musicians]] were session men.	Male
10493	Usually, the [[assistant]] replaced the [[examiner]] in case of death or resignation.	Amb,Amb
10494	Deliberately running into an [[opponent]] to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but nothing could be done about it (at [[Patroclus']] funeral games, [[Antilochus]] in fact causes [[Menelaus]] to crash in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
10495	In Aztec warfare the [[tlacochcalcatl]] was second in command only to the [[tlatoani]] and he usually lead the Aztec [[army]] into battle when the [[ruler]] was otherwise occupied.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb

10507	However, not only as [[Greeks]], but primarily as Europeans, we cannot but treat these networks as an important tool in our endeavour to strengthen social and economic cohesion, employment and sustainable development in our struggle to achieve European integration. And, of course, [[I]] disagree with what Mrs [[Schroedter]] has just said.	Amb,Amb,Female
10508	The integration of a [[partner]] with the economic and political size of China into the multilateral trade system will undoubtedly form one of the most important factors in the world economy at the beginning of this new century.	Amb
10509	It is simply not practical if [[you]] run a small business, and [[someone]] discovers after twelve months that he was discriminated against in a selection procedure which involved forty [[candidates]], to keep each and every file from that period and then investigate exactly what happened during that selection procedure once more. [[They]] might not even remember the candidate involved.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
10510	Mr [[President]], this question, as Mr [[Harbour]] will be aware, has direct relevance to the question raised by Mrs [[Theorin]] because [[we]] believe that amongst the many other justifications for making changes, as regards appraisal and the advance towards a more linear career structure, will be to give fairer treatment to women [[officials]], and indeed to make the [[Commission]] more attractive for the employment of women, particularly women who have [[family]] obligations.	Male,Male,Female,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
10511	Various surveys have shown that many hundreds of thousands of [[employees]], predominantly [[women]], encounter this, with all the adverse consequences for their health and their career.	Female,Female
10512	So if [[we]] want to create a positive environment for the development of electronic commerce and third generation mobile services, now is the time to make sure that the uptake of wireless Internet services is not hampered by huge amounts of junk mail which the [[consumer]] is paying for against his will.

10513	The [[presidency]] is in contact with Mr [[Baker]].	Amb,Male
10514	Think of the emphasis that is now being placed upon the need today also for male [[managers]] to be able to incorporate feminine values into their management styles.	Male
10515	Let [[me]] quote the typical example of the decoupling of subsidies from production, which the [[rapporteur]] welcomes, together with the conversion of intervention schemes to simple insurance networks and the exit of [[farmers]] from the market to become businessmen, to quote Mr [[Fischler]].	Amb,Amb,Male,Male
10516	Mr [[Bushill-Matthews]], who is no longer present in the Chamber, asked a question that [[I]] imagine relates to a specific incident.	Male,Amb
10517	Thank [[you]] for that answer, but may [[I]] remind you that, unlike the United States Supreme [[Court]], which is appointed by the federal institutions of the US, our Court of Justice is actually appointed by the Member States, yet it seems to be Member States themselves that complain about some of its judgments.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10518	He has been a fair, frank, and [[I]] am pleased to say federalist [[companion]].	Amb,Male
10519	[[They]] should also be given the opportunity to return from maternity leave to the labour market, but also to further studies.	Female
10520	That is not the priority for [[employees]]; what they seek and demand is respect for their fundamental rights.	Amb
10521	(PL) Mr [[President]], the European Union places great value on the proper treatment of [[animals]] during the entire period of breeding, from birth to the slaughterhouse.	Male,Amb
10522	[[I]] have personally heard the Maltese [[authorities]] saying that Libya allowed a number of boats to depart in awful conditions and that subsequently the Maltese [[navy]] was forced to go out and find and save the poor [[people]] who were being exploited by the [[smugglers]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10523	However, [[we]] felt that, once the [[candidate]] had presented his guidelines, there was no point in saying once again that we were going to wait a few weeks or months.	Amb,Male
10524	The [[Committee]] on Budgets has also worked constructively with other [[institutions]] in the past.	Amb,Amb
10525	[[We]] have tabled an amendment with Mrs [[d'Ancona]] which will, [[I]] hope, with the assent of Mrs [[Roth]], be accepted, because in Greece, which is the only Member State with no border with another Member State and in which military service is compulsory under the constitution, the issue is quite a contentious one.

12664	The second key element of the report concerns the matter [[I]] had occasion to highlight months ago to the Italian [[Ambassador]] himself, even before [[anyone]] else, for it is primarily an Italian issue: the incompatibility between holding the office of [[Member]] of the European Parliament, on the one hand, and that of member of a national parliament, regional councillor or - I would add sotto voce, calling on Mr [[Napolitano]] to take note of the fact - mayor of a big city, on the other.

Amb,Male,Amb
12678	Furthermore, the appointment of the [[Secretary General]] of NATO as a representative of the European Common Foreign and Security Policy, appears to complete the picture, and brings to mind that phrase of a French [[diplomat]] who said that it is illusory to try to develop a European defence policy while building the European Central Bank in Fort Knox.
