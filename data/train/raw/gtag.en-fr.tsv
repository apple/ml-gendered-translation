4047	There has to be positive action by [[governments]] in favour of enabling [[people]] to experience working elsewhere: Mrs [[Van Lancker]] has already refereed to the coordination of social security systems within this.	Amb,Amb,Female
4048	Report (A5-0175/2001) by Mrs [[Myller]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision laying down the Community Environment Action Programme 2001-2010 [COM(2001) 31 - C5-0032/2001 - 2001/0029(COD)]	Female,Amb
4049	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to thank the [[rapporteur]] for his sterling work and focus on three paragraphs towards the end of the report.	Male,Amb,Male
4050	[[We]] must therefore welcome the positive solution we have finally achieved, even if it does not entirely satisfy [[everyone]].	Amb,Amb
4051	[[We]] must defend freedom of the press, the rights and freedoms of the [[child]], the rights and freedoms of [[homosexuals]], of [[minorities]], the rights of [[women]], ethnic [[minorities]], the rights of [[refugees]], and, yes, unfashionably, [[those]] seeking asylum.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb

4053	Even though the number of female [[candidates]] is now larger than the number of male [[candidates]] in almost all European countries, women come up against major obstacles in the male-dominated market for jobs in science.	Female,Male
4054	Mrs [[Wallis]] very aptly said that it is not simply a matter of implementing or adopting the directive but a matter of both implementing the directive and involving [[everyone]] who is affected by the directive.	Female,Amb
4055	[[I]] am sorry that the [[representative]] of the [[Council]] has repeated that language and that lack of balance in her introduction this morning.	Amb,Female,Amb
4056	The Belgian [[minister]] for justice has also set in motion investigations into this matter, and her [[department]] is, in the initial stages at any rate, the right one to be investigating this sort of thing, for, according to current law, it is the Belgian legal system that must take action and make inquiries.	Female,Amb
4057	'[[I]] am against Guantánamo because I think it is a violation of human rights', he says crisply.	Male
4058	In other words, what is expected of Europe in the Southern Mediterranean in this respect is that it finally overcomes what the former representative of the United Nations [[Secretary-]][[General]], Mr [[de Soto]], quite rightly called self-censorship with regard to Israel and the persistent violations of international law and its own commitments.	Male,Amb,Male
4059	Yes, Mr [[Radwan]], some of what you say is absolutely right.	Male
4060	[[She]] has more courage than all the male [[Commissioners]] combined, as she dared to oppose Mr [[Sarkozy]], even though Mr [[Barroso]] had tried to dissuade her from doing so for a long time.	Female,Male,Male,Male
4061	Drumcree and Garvaghy Road manifest our divisions in Northern Ireland. [[I]] have to say the [[Chief Constable]] got everything totally wrong and he now holds the trust of very [[few]] in the Province.	Amb,Male,Amb
4062	That's where the money has to come from - from taxation - and then [[we]] can think about what we want to do for [[whom]].	Amb,Amb
4063	As the report on the application of the directive - drawn up by the [[Commission]] after a delay of at least three years - has not been presented to [[Parliament]], the [[Committee]] on [[Women']]s Rights has had to compile an own-initiative report on these invisible [[victims]] of discrimination, the assisting wives working in millions of [[family]] businesses, especially in agriculture, the SMEs, crafts and trade, though not excluding those with professional [[spouses]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Female,Amb,Amb
4064	Last week [[I]] accompanied the Prime Minister, Mr [[Junker]], to Ukraine, within the context of a visit linked both to the European Union/Ukraine summit and to bilateral relations.	Amb,Male
4065	Of the points made in the report, [[I]] think that the most important are the ones relating to the personal interests of [[officials]] and, secondly, the organisation of the [[Commission]] itself.	Amb,Amb,Amb
4066	My own opinion is that a sick [[athlete]] should be able to take whatever drugs the [[doctor]] prescribes to help him recover, whereas a healthy [[athlete]] should take nothing other than what is contained in a balanced diet.	Male,Amb,Amb

4177	Again, Mr [[Santini]], in relation to citation 12, you are correct.	Male
4178	Furthermore, and given that the measures to prevent or restrict the introduction of pollutants into groundwater are a vital element of the proposed directive, it is very important, despite what the previous [[speaker]] said, that [[we]] approve the compromise amendment on Article 6, which we have presented jointly with other [[Members]], in order to ensure that Member States control indirect dumping on the basis of best environmental practices and techniques that are sufficient to prevent such dumping.	Amb,Amb,Amb

Amb,Male,Male,Amb,Amb
4181	Half of your [[ministers]] are women.	Female
4182	It is also absolutely vital that [[we]] should succeed in narrowing the gulf between the EU and its [[citizens]]; the message must go out loud and clear - and not only to the [[people]] of France and the Netherlands - that we are willing to learn from the 'no' votes in those countries, and that that means that we are willing to look at other ways of doing European politics in the future.	Amb,Amb,Amb

4187	I would like to raise yet another matter, as a [[representative]] of Poland and as a representative of Central and Eastern Europe: all funds which go towards the development of our region, which is a huge consumer of goods developed and produced in Western Europe, and all money invested in the new countries of Europe, is money invested in the future of Europe.	Amb
4188	It is a good [[model]], too, because of the different things he did.	Male
4189	Commissioner [[Reding]] should be credited with having had the honesty to confirm that this warrant has had problems and causes doubts, and that there are proportionality tests, which must be passed when warrants are issued and which should not be applied automatically without a [[judge]] having a slower, more measured look at them.	Amb,Amb
4190	And this rule requires a Spanish [[lawyer]], for example, not to take part in a case involving the statutory provisions of a Catalan will, although his professional title formally permits him to do so, in exactly the same way as it requires him not to participate in a case involving German inheritance law.	Male
4191	Mr [[President]], the [[Commissioner]] has not responded to the worsening situation of [[women]] in Iran, as presented by three fellow [[Members]], namely the fact that women can no longer be treated by male [[doctors]] and that women doctors in Iran are few and far between.	Male,Amb,Female,Amb,Male
4192	Against that background [[we]] welcome the fact that the [[President-in-Office]] of the Council has indicated that already, at this stage, there is an agreement that money available for enlargement will be set aside.	Amb,Amb

4284	Mr [[President]], this question, as Mr [[Harbour]] will be aware, has direct relevance to the question raised by Mrs [[Theorin]] because [[we]] believe that amongst the many other justifications for making changes, as regards appraisal and the advance towards a more linear career structure, will be to give fairer treatment to women [[officials]], and indeed to make the [[Commission]] more attractive for the employment of women, particularly women who have [[family]] obligations.

4287	Mr [[Farage]], you will take the floor, but first of all [[I]] would like to make it very clear that, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, your request is late, for two reasons at least: because it has not been presented within the time limits laid down and because the request for an oral question to the [[Commission]] has not been presented within the time limits laid down either.

4294	Mr [[Barroso]], beyond the technical problems explained by our fellow [[Members]], such as Mr [[Désir]] who spoke just now, the problem is a cultural problem and a problem of choice.	Male,Male,Male

4299	However, [[I]] believe that the number of cases of violence, including [[family]] violence, should lead [[us]] to take the side of those who suffer the most serious damage from lack of support: female [[victims]] of violence are statistically a much more dominant share than the few [[criminals]] who take advantage of the system to get the better of innocent [[men]].

4303	In the fight against misfortune and tragedy, and very often against reality - however hard it may be -, the best weapons, although they may not seem like it, are not the resources that have to be used in an efficient and coordinated manner, as Mrs [[Ferrero-Waldner]] pointed out.	Female
4304	That interpretation is shared by the other [[institutions]] and has been the practice for a number of years.	Amb
4305	[[I]] hope very much, Mr [[President]], and clearly from the debate so far, our [[colleagues]] also share this concern, that they will support all the amendments and I thank Mrs [[Smet]] very much for the amount of serious consideration she has given to this particular issue.

8575	Everything which has taken place in the Balkans in recent years, to use the words of a leading Greek [[poet]], 'without caution, without shame' , has been in a bid to correct one wrong with myriad other wrongs and has simply turned this Convention into a well-turned piece of literature with no teeth.

9481	There was a [[minister]] for agriculture who made a senseless comment that [[people]] should 'stop eating uncooked produce altogether', even though she had no authority for the matter.	Female,Amb
9482	Seen as a whole, this is an important contribution towards replacing the status of [[women employees]] with that of female working [[citizens]], and in quantitative terms it is a significant contribution.	Female,Female
9483	And there is in France, from this point of view, much abuse where trade union freedom is concerned, since it is only possible for [[workers]] to stand for professional elections if they are members of unions which are duly approved and limited by law.	Amb
9484	[[I]] should appreciate it if [[you]] would tell Mr [[White]] that today is 11 April 1997 and that 1977 was 20 years ago, when he still had a black beard and hair on his head.	Amb,Amb,Male
9485	In conclusion, let [[me]] offer the [[Commission]] some advice: do not confuse Mr [[Elles']] statement that "the [[auditor]] is a watchdog not a bloodhound' with the saying "his bark is worse than his bite' .	Amb,Amb,Male,Male
9486	Personally, and [[I]] wish to say this before Parliament, I regret that such importance was given to the events surrounding the appointment of Mr [[Duisenberg]].	Amb,Male

11228	[[I]] do think it would be useful if Mrs [[Malmström]] could repeat today in the European Parliament what her [[Ambassador]] said in the United Nations - that the EU urges Israel and the [[Palestinians]] to launch appropriate, credible and independent domestic investigations of human rights violations in relation to the Gaza conflict.

Amb,Female,Male
11234	This was a request from an English [[colleague]] in the Committee on the Environment, and [[I]] am pleased to accept her proposal.	Female,Amb
11235	[[I]] believe that [[we]] are heading towards a European architecture in which liberty and security go hand in hand, and in which in effect - and I think Mrs [[Roth]] was quite right to bring this up - it will be necessary to keep careful watch that a correct balance is maintained between the legitimate aspiration of the [[people]] for more liberty within our European Union, and their aspiration, no less legitimate, for more security.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb

11639	The question of artistic training is complicated: creativity has to be stimulated by a special and individualised [[teacher]]-[[student]] approach, knowledge of Europe's continuously evolving culture and of creative tools has to be imparted, and an unrestricted career development path has to be made possible.	Amb,Amb
11640	[[I]] firmly believe that the representation of [[women]] in politics should not be based on the introduction of mandatory quotas, which would establish minimum numbers of female [[candidates]], but on the ability of female [[politicians]] to seek, adopt and promote the kind of issues that will help women to solve their actual problems.

Amb,Amb,Amb
11646	In my view, after all the criticism which has been levelled at the lack of progress in promoting equality of opportunity between [[men]] and [[women]], the [[Council]] should be more active in initiating discussions and ensuring that there are more than the three, or possibly four, women [[candidates]] currently rumoured to be in the running.

Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
12263	After that [[I]] have been meeting [[him]] frequently.	Amb,Male
12264	This sudden increase is understandable: during the wars and disturbed periods of the Later Han and thereafter, every powerful [[person]] was ambitious to use his strength to acquire political power and tended to keep a large number of [[retainers]] who actually were his personal troops.

12281	After all, [[we]] recently heard great criticism of the [[Commission President]] by our esteemed fellow Member Mr [[Schulz]] and, as Mr Schulz is, of course, known for his objectivity, [[I]] am assuming he will be very complimentary about the Commission President’s speech in his own speech shortly.	Amb,Male,Male,Amb

Female
12292	[[I]] fully recognize the grievous conditions to which Mr [[Colom i Naval]] draws attention.	Amb,Male
12293	So if Honourable [[Members]] can exert any pressure, [[I]] think they could usefully target it on the other Community institution.	Amb,Amb
