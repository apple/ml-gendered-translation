806	Madam [[President]], the following problem has arisen in connection with the report by Mrs [[Schierhuber]] now being put to the vote: the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European United Left filed a motion for a split vote on a number of points.	Female,Female
807	The first, to which my [[colleague]] referred, is political dialogue.	Amb
808	With the proposed enlargement of the European Union to central and eastern Europe, [[we]] must take a strong hand in safeguarding our European objective which, of course, is to develop agriculture as a major and competitive [[player]] in world trade.	Amb,Amb
809	This matter has been reported on recently in the UK and indeed a British Government [[adviser]] said that she would not recommend that her [[children]] eat French beef because, she alleged, in France older [[cows]] are still making their way into the food chain, parts from the nervous system are still being used in products such as sausages in France and there is still contamination of [[animal]] feed.	Female,Amb,Female,Amb
810	Then, some years later, when [[I]] allowed my second daughter, who is six or seven years younger, to go out on her own, [[Elisabetta]] protested: "But [[Daddy]], you never let me go out on my own and here you are, letting my [[sister]] out alone, and she is younger than I was!"	Amb,Female,Male,Female
811	Even within this last [[group I]] would distinguish between [[those]] who are the children of [[farmers]] who work on the land and those who are descendants of [[farmers]] who, from the size of their holdings, are really agricultural businessmen.	Amb,Amb,Male,Male
812	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would like to express the full support of the ELDR Group for the reports by Mr [[Marset]] and Mr [[Salafranca]] of the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy, regarding the EU/Chile Association Agreement and the interregional agreement with Mercosur.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Male,Male
813	As a [[group]], too, we are very clearly in favour of extending the three-pillar model, meaning public systems, occupational systems involving both [[employers]] and [[employees]], and private or individual schemes.	Amb,Amb,Amb
814	The final point [[I]] will make, Mr [[President]], is that I agree with the [[rapporteur]] when he says that the pension system should include individualisation of pensions, social security and taxation systems.	Amb,Male,Male
815	Only once my [[assistant]] had picked herself up and gone into the House did she receive any support or help from the security [[staff]].	Female,Amb
816	Since there will be at least 200 million [[pensioners]] in the enlarged Europe, [[I]] hope that, when the Hungarian [[representatives]] join the European Parliament, it will be possible to have a number of [[MEPs]] which is proportional and proportionate to the number of pensioners in Europe.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
817	In the meantime, [[I]] think it would be very sensible – and this also supports Mrs [[Napoletano]] – for [[us]] to involve [[them]] in this initiative.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
818	[[I]] accept the two amendments presented by Mr [[Guerreiro]], as well as Amendment 17, presented by Mrs [[Stihler]].	Amb,Male,Female
819	(ES) Mr [[Borrell]], tomorrow you will have the opportunity to change this system.	Male
820	[[We]] have lost, and are still losing, or at least eroding, values such as work, discipline, self-reliance, that is to say all those values which go towards creating a good [[citizen]] when these people reach adulthood.	Amb,Amb
821	So in these cases of conflict, it is not fair to just say that [[you]] can have a sort of voluntary mediation by the Level 3 [[Committees]] followed simply by advice to the lead [[supervisor]], and then in the end the lead supervisor can either comply or explain that he is deviating from this advice.	Amb,Amb,Male
822	This attitude overlooks the fact that both [[sides]] make use of unacceptable violence and that it was the [[government]] that broke off the peace process established by the [[Norwegians]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
823	[[I]] wish to thank the Swedish Presidency for its efforts and, above all, now that Christmas is here, Mr [[Reinfeldt]].	Amb,Male
824	[[I]] recall that this matter was subject to a simplified legislative procedure so as to speed it up. The [[Chair]] of the Committee on Regional Development herself was the rapporteur for the proposal, which has allowed it to be submitted to plenary for voting without it being put to debate.	Amb,Female
825	Here [[we]] are not talking about the export-oriented medium-sized [[company]] from Baden-Württemberg with a hundred [[employees]], but small craft enterprises, the flower shop, the [[baker]] around the corner, the newly founded IT start-up business.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
826	It will also be the case that these changes will encourage [[employers]] to choose male [[candidates]] over [[women]].	Amb,Male,Female
827	The views expressed by Herr [[Schulz]] meet the case.	Male
828	[[She]] has more courage than all the male [[Commissioners]] combined, as she dared to oppose Mr [[Sarkozy]], even though Mr [[Barroso]] had tried to dissuade her from doing so for a long time.	Female,Male,Male,Male
829	According to statistics, [[women farmers]] in the European Union account for 43% of farm [[labourers]] and 20% of farm [[managers]], and this does not include the [[spouses]] of male [[farmers]] whose work is often not taken into account.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Male
830	Madam [[President]], on a point of order - and [[I]] tried to make this point halfway through the debate, but you cut me off - I would suggest that you look back over this debate and see how you allocated blue card questions and catch-the-eye requests.	Female,Amb
831	[[I]] take note of your comments, Mrs [[d'Ancona]], and I myself will be raising the question in the Bureau of whether it is possible to arrange the order of business in such a way as to deal with the human rights issues item by item, in order to make the debate more coherent.	Amb,Female
832	Is it the [[President]] or the [[Vice-President]] or the [[Secretary of State]] or is it the [[Chairman]] of the National Security Council, or is it [[Congress]] or is it some special [[envoy]]?	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
833	As [[I]] mentioned at the beginning of my comments, I am very pleased with the report and the proposal under discussion, since the proposals will contribute to the further development of the waste policy.	Amb
834	[[I]] myself lived under and worked against a dictatorship in my own country, Spain, and I know how basic a requirement it is when [[one]] is underground to be as prudent as possible with regard to [[persons]] lending assistance from the inside.	Amb,Amb,Amb
835	[[I]] think some of these absolutely must be kept in mind and [[we]] must seriously think about converting them into reality, into concrete provisions. I refer to lifting banking secrecy when international assistance is requested, introducing rules which would allow a European [[judge]] to talk directly to his [[colleagues]], without going through tortuous, lengthy and wearisome procedures, and the importance of new common types of offence, especially where economic crime is concerned.

837	The situation of laying [[hens]] in various systems of rearing is serious from an [[animal]] welfare point of view.	Female,Amb
838	[[I]] did not realise that she was such a fine [[diplomat]] when it comes to politics and the telecommunications and radio sector.	Amb,Female
839	As a relatively liberal, perhaps very liberal, European [[politician]] where agriculture is concerned, I should like to say that [[we]] ourselves within the EU ought to reflect upon how we can change the CAP, Agenda 2000 and what follows Agenda 2000 and consider how we might get rid of subsidies which drive down the level of trade.	Amb,Amb
840	Finally, [[I]] would like to ask the [[representative]] of the European Commission, with regard to this last point as well as to the report in general, if he is really going to take account of the recommendations made within the framework of this consultation, once they have been approved by this [[Parliament]].

1337	Firstly, it has a very strong technical dimension, which is embodied in particular in the report by Mrs [[Ainardi]].

1353	[[I]] drafted a preliminary proposal for the [[Committee]] on the Environment based on this questionnaire.	Amb,Amb
1354	[[I]] think that these terrible statistics, Madam [[President]], should lead [[us]] to think profoundly about the role of our [[Parliament]], which I do not see as a court that punishes and pontificates, but as an institution that has its own effective strategies for seeking, by mutual agreement with our [[partners]] and on the basis of dialogue, cooperation and good practice, solutions for eradicating this process.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb

1358	However, forced employment, where the [[worker]] has no choice, but is perhaps unable to find a job, looks like part-time unemployment.	Amb
1359	Furthermore, [[we]] must not forget either the role of [[women]] in agriculture in Europe and their contribution to it: one-third of agricultural [[workers]] are women.	Amb,Female,Female
1360	[[I]] believe that action needs to be taken at both European and national level to protect [[consumers]] against unfair terms for repaying loans and credit cards and to establish terms for accessing loans which will prevent [[households]] from getting into excessive debt and, consequently, from facing poverty and social exclusion.	Amb,Amb,Amb
1361	In the wake of cases tried in the Court of Justice of the European Union, this directive aims to clarify and reinforce [[users']] right of access to safe and high quality cross-border healthcare, by promoting [[patient]] mobility within the EU, and by reinforcing the Member States' cooperation and solidarity in this area.	Amb,Amb
1362	That also means - although Mrs [[Pack]] has not mentioned that - that these freedoms must be reciprocal and that freedom of religion must also be respected in countries where Islam is not the majority religion.	Female

1368	Because the contract had been signed by the previous Conservative [[Government]], Mr [[Cook]] claimed it could not be broken.	Amb,Male
1369	The [[representative]] of the Council' [[s]] response is ambiguous and somewhat schizophrenic in nature. On the one hand, he says that [[we]] need to implement the criteria but, on the other hand, he says things are running smoothly in Turkey and so we can proceed.	Male,Amb,Amb

2859	Our rapporteur, Mrs [[Villiers]], who has been responsible for some excellent work, mentioned in her report the possibility of applying a fast track method.	Female
2860	It has been a long haul from the first [[women's]] suffrage, in Finland in 1904, to gender-balanced political lists in France, and [[we]] still have a long way to go before we can take women [[presidents]], [[mayors]], [[ministers]] and party [[chairs]] for granted as a part of everyday life.	Female,Amb,Female,Female,Female,Female
2861	[[I]] would ask the Commissioner, Mrs [[Diamantopoulou]], to seek some initiative which will contribute to resolving this problem.	Amb,Female
2862	The European Parliament and the Council are co-legislators and [[we]] do not have to blindly support any directive, Mr [[Pronk]]. We have to support positions, namely those of Parliament.	Amb,Male

Male,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
2864	Turning to the [[Cunha]] report, may [[I]] firstly place on record, as Mr [[Fischler]] and Mr [[Varela Suanzes-Carpegna]] have done before me, the great appreciation of the [[members]] of the Fisheries Committee and indeed of most if not all of the Members of this House for the work undertaken by Mr Cunha during his term of office as an MEP representing Portugal.

2865	Finally, as regards the last question, Recital 5 of the aforementioned Regulation No 1567/2003 provides as follows: ‘The [[Community]] and its Member States uphold the right of their [[individuals]] to decide freely on the number and spacing of their [[children]]; they condemn any violation of human rights in the form of compulsory abortion, compulsory sterilisation, infanticide, or the rejection, abandonment or abuse of unwanted children as a means of curbing population growth’.	Amb,Amb,Amb
2866	[[I]] believe that the report by my colleague Mrs [[Prets]] will help [[us]] make some progress.	Amb,Female,Amb
2867	[[I]] propose to the House an oral amendment to paragraph 2 to add, after the reference to the Italian humanitarian workers, [[Simona Torretta]] and [[Simona Pari]], the words ‘and the British [[citizen]]’ – followed by his full name – so that the European Parliament can issue a timely call for the release of this other [[citizen]] of our Union and guarantee him the support of all the political forces represented within it.

2868	The report by Mrs [[Attwooll]] accurately illustrates the role that [[they]] have played and the role that [[women’s]] networks may yet play in this field and calls upon national [[administrations]] and the [[Commission]] to continue providing and intensifying their support.

2874	The way that Mr [[Susta]], the [[rapporteur]], and all the shadow [[rapporteurs]] - and here [[I]] would like to thank particularly [[Kader Arif]] from my [[group]] - have handled it increased considerably the predefined scope for [[Parliament]] to take action.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb

2877	[[I]] am afraid that as long as this does not happen and as long as [[someone]] who was a member of the [[government]] which sanctioned shooting at [[people]] can be Vice-Chairwoman of Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, , [[we]] cannot have any real confidence and the moral authority in another country, to ask for this kind of investigation to be carried out in a country outside the European Union.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
2878	Especially the political [[decision makers]] who, following the lead of Mr [[Zapatero]] and Ambassador [[Moratinos]], have changed European policy towards Cuba.	Amb,Male,Amb
2879	The universal service provided by our postal [[administrations]] must remain economically viable, by which [[I]] mean that [[we]] must not confine it to such an extent that the result would be an impoverishment of the minimum basic postal service to which all our [[citizens]] are entitled.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
2880	But there should also have been a provision that a [[lawyer]] so admitted to the profession of the host Member State must use his home-country professional qualification alongside the professional qualification of the host Member State.	Male
2881	Madam [[President]], there is a lot of money at stake in the reports presented by Mr [[Arias Cañete]], Mrs [[Klaß]] and Mr [[Viola]], and indeed in the countless other reports which [[we]] have been working on for months in the Committee on Regional Policy. This money is being redistributed from the pockets of [[citizens]] who live in the better-off countries - and [[I]] am deliberately not referring to the net [[contributors]] - to fund projects in the less wealthy and structurally underdeveloped Member States.	Female,Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
2882	[[Women]] will be treated only by female [[doctors]] and [[men]] only by male [[doctors]].	Female,Female,Male,Male

Amb,Amb,Male
2884	The idea that in all circumstances the fact that [[you]] have a [[lawyer]] sitting by you guarantees you the normal minimum of [[consumer]] protection does not seem to be a satisfactory point to raise.	Amb,Amb,Amb

3999	Mr [[President]], when [[I]] started out in politics some thirty years ago, and I went along to the preliminary meeting of the Mexico World Conference on Women, which took place in New York, I accompanied the only female [[diplomat]] our country had at the time.	Male,Amb,Female
4000	[[I]] ask [[Members]] of this Parliament what they would think if a [[lawyer]] had a suspicion that his [[client]] was preparing some money laundering activity?	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
4001	[[We]] have thus focused on the [[man]] instead of stigmatising the [[person]] who is prostituting herself.	Amb,Male,Female
4002	[[I]] would therefore ask Belgium' s [[representative]] if she could continue the policy adopted by Sweden in this matter and reply to me in writing, in her capacity as Belgian Minister, stating the answer to this question, and also which country Belgium considers to be the most federalist state in Europe; the totally unfounded claim has been put forward that this country would be Finland.	Amb,Female
4003	Finally, as Mrs [[Morgan]] has already stated, the Member States fail to implement legislation adequately.	Female
4004	In conclusion, as Mr [[Karas]] said earlier, [[I]] have been struck by the tremendous dignity and high quality of this debate.	Male,Amb
4005	The case of the Guantánamo Bay [[prisoners]] is the most flagrant illustration of the fact that the USA does not respect fundamental rights, insofar as it has brought these men before special courts and completely violated their right to defence.	Male
4006	Thank you very much, Mr [[Leinen]].	Male
4007	Mrs [[Randzio-Plath]], [[I]] can only shake my head at that.	Female,Amb
4008	[[I]] acknowledge that the task [[we]] have set ourselves is enormous and extremely ambitious, but unless the pace picks up and the [[Council’s]] decision-making ability is increased, we will reach the end of this five-year period having failed to meet the objectives set out in Tampere.	Amb,Amb,Amb
4009	[[Madam President]], [[Commissioner]], [[I]] would firstly like to congratulate the [[rapporteur]] on his report, because I believe this is an important opportunity to establish common control of the European Union's external borders.	Female,Amb,Amb,Male
4010	[[We]] asked the [[referee]], the referee gave us her decision and [[I]] do not believe that it is for us to try to second-guess her.	Amb,Female,Amb
4011	Failure to do so may well make him a bad [[mayor]], but he is not violating human rights.	Male
4012	[[I]] can inform the [[House]] meanwhile that, in its current lifetime, the [[Commission]] will hit its target of ensuring that 20% of its middle and senior [[managers]] are women.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
4013	As [[you]] all know, it is essential to provide all political [[candidates]] with equal access to the media.	Amb,Amb
4014	. Mr [[President]], the fine speech delivered by Mr [[Junker]] together with the particular emphasis of subsequent speeches are in stark contrast to the extremely disappointing and worrying content of the draft resolution submitted to [[us]] on behalf of the majority of [[groups]] on the 60th anniversary of the [[Nazi]] surrender.	Male,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
4015	The ineffable Commissioner [[Mandelson]] is like [[Molière’s]] doctor: he waits for his [[patient]] to die in order to ascertain his illness.	Male,Amb,Male
4016	My role in this debate consists exclusively of explaining what has happened in this Parliament during comitology and expressing my full support for the position of the rapporteur, my colleague Mr [[Radwan]].	Male
4017	Mr [[President]], this is wrong: you give the floor to [[someone]] who was supposed to speak in favour of the proposal, and here he is speaking against it.	Male,Male
4018	Similarly, our work with national [[experts]] on [[teacher]] training stresses the importance of European knowledge, mobility and networking. These are a very important part of teachers’ professional development.	Amb,Amb
4019	The [[Commission's]] new proposals are divorcing aid from production and transferring direct aid resources for [[farmers]] to the second pillar, to the benefit mainly of [[businessmen]].	Amb,Amb,Male
4020	It has already been stated here that there are more [[women]] undergraduate [[students]] in universities than [[men]]; this is also true of Master's and Doctoral degree [[students]] - there are more women.	Female,Female,Male,Female
4021	Nevertheless, Mr [[Moraes]], [[we]] need to recognise that in terms of the surrender of [[nationals]], we are occasionally seeing old extradition procedures being used which is a sign of the residual lack of confidence in some Member States and in certain criminal justice systems.	Male,Amb,Amb
4022	This crisis can be seen most of all in the very real fears and anxieties of the [[citizens]] of the European Union.	Amb
4023	(FR) Madam [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], first of all, [[I]] would like to thank the [[rapporteur]] for the work she has done, and our fellow [[Members]] for their hard work in creating this new microfinance instrument.	Female,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Female,Amb
4024	[[Nobody]] can now say who the [[attacker]] was: he says she attacked him.	Amb,Female
4025	However, the [[authorities]] in these countries are using brute force against the [[demonstrators]], killing many [[people]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
4026	Finally, Mr [[President]], [[we]] do not believe strictly financial intervention can really create new jobs. Employment can be stimulated by the state, as you are well aware, but what creates it is the spontaneous initiative of [[individuals]], above all small and medium-sized [[firms]] growing in a rich humus of economic and social activity.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
4027	In the case of the maritime industry Mr [[Katiforis]] indeed pointed out that it too was until recently regarded as obsolete.	Male
4028	Madame [[Chairman]], in the IGC document, employment is once again reduced to mere rhetoric, the social sector lacks method and democracy is hindered by bureaucracy.	Female
4029	There is, for example, insufficient guidance on risk assessment, to which the [[rapporteur]] also drew attention in his speech.	Male
4030	Once again my thanks to the [[Parliament]]. [[I]] should like your understanding for the fact that neither Mr [[Oreja]] nor my female [[colleague]] could be here today.	Amb,Amb,Male,Female
4031	Yet [[I]] cannot avoid making two critical observations on the procedure for today's debate, and I address my remarks to you, Mr [[President]], together with a request.	Amb,Male
4032	For example, the [[Italians]] have successfully moved into overseas markets, based on their strength and [[customer]] service, and they have actually avoided competing head-on with low cost imports.	Amb,Amb
4033	This has had a crucial impact on single [[parents]], most of whom are women, and force them into low-paid, slave labour employment, or sometimes into training schemes which are very inadequate.	Female
4034	As for the global nature of this problem, I have received, in my capacity as [[chairman]] of the [[committee]], a letter from an Iranian [[organisation]] pointing out that [[women]] in Iran are still being stoned.	Male,Amb,Amb,Female
4035	A certain Finnish television [[reporter]], who had used a quite harmless memo on the Tampere meeting he had got from a [[Member]] of Parliament, received a communication from the [[Secretary-General]] and the [[Speaker]] at the Finnish Parliament banning him indefinitely from entering the Parliament building.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
4036	[[Ward]] has stated that he talks with his [[father]] about once every two years.	Male,Male
4037	However, a [[reporter]] for the New York Times wrote that when he had tried to walk across the bridge in 1968, it was closed.	Male
4038	Despite this, in post-combat surveys, 94 percent of [[soldiers]] rated the M4 as an effective weapons system.	Amb
4039	As the [[leader]] of the largest opposition party in Denmark, she was described by the media as the leader of the Danish opposition.	Female
4040	The [[singer]] also performed the song on her Lady Wood Tour.	Female
4041	The [[director]] defended his decision to shoot almost all of the film in Spanish in an interview: "[[You]] can't make a film with any level of credibility in this case unless it's in Spanish.	Male,Amb
4042	He is a [[professor]] of international law, contract law, and bankruptcy, among other areas.	Male
4043	Similarly, in the Case of Proclamations in 1611, [[Coke]] held that the [[monarch]] could only exercise those prerogatives he already had, and not create new ones.	Amb,Male
4044	Her first stage name as a [[dancer]] was "[[Jennasis]]", which she later used as the name of a business that she incorporated ("Jennasis Killing Co.").	Female,Female
4045	[[She]] was not the first [[witness]] to be evasive, sarcastic and crude.	Female,Female
4046	The [[publisher]] noted at this time that dōjinshi were not usually a cause of concern for him.	Male
4047	Often the insight they gain allows them to see why their [[spouse]] felt unhappy in the marriage; thus helping them to improve as a [[person]].	Amb,Amb
4048	[[Oscar]] and [[Josephine]] had five [[children]], of whom two were to become kings of Sweden and Norway.	Amb,Amb,Male

4051	Another [[witness]] identified a sketch of [[Frank Morris]], saying it bore a striking resemblance to a man she had seen in the area.	Female,Male
4052	In the course of the official investigation, [[Lubbers]] wrote a letter which [[some]] considered was a threat to the female [[worker]] who had brought the charges.	Amb,Amb,Female
4053	[[Francesc Matheu]] collected much of her poetry in 1909, after the [[writer]] died, in a book published in Barcelona, "Poesies de Victòria Penya d'Amer" ("Poems by Victòria Penya d'Amer").	Amb,Female
4054	The original [[band]] had a lineup of three [[singers]] and three [[sidemen]].	Amb,Amb,Male
4055	A mysterious [[figure]] slips a piece of paper into her hands.	Female
4056	The official figure in the United Kingdom, for example, is about 50% of the number of acts of violence by [[men]] against [[women]], but there are indications that only about 10% of male [[victims]] of female violence report the incidents to the [[authorities]], mainly due to taboos and fears of misunderstanding created by a culture of masculine expectations.	Male,Female,Male,Amb
4057	As [[Hammond's]] [[agent]], she wielded a sceptre that cast realistic illusions.	Amb,Female
4058	[[He]] said past films had been "brilliantly written by [[women]] and then rendered into films by male [[directors]] who reduce the potency of the female [[characters]]".	Male,Female,Male,Female
4059	[[He]] then confronts [[Dean]] about his reckless behavior since his deal with a Crossroads Demon, which left him only a year to live.	Male,Male
4060	At the request of the [[crowd]], [[Maeda]] wrestled a [[cadet]] and threw him easily.	Amb,Amb,Male
4061	Outside of, [[you]] know, his controversial aspects, [[I]] just think he's a great [[artist]] and musicmaker and beatmaker.	Amb,Amb,Male
4062	[[Estraven]] tries to return to the land border with [[Orgoreyn]], because he is still exiled from Karhide, but is killed by border [[guards]], who capture [[Ai]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
4063	His title changed to [[Professor]] of Psychology in 1928 when a separate Department of Psychology was created.	Male
4064	The [[British]], however, did not accommodate [[Tirpitz's]] projections; from his appointment as the First Sea Lord in 1904, [[Fisher]] began a major reorganization of the Royal Navy.	Amb,Amb,Male
4065	After being [[professor]] at Harvard he returned to Brazil.	Male
4066	Production designer [[J. Michael Riva]] saw footage of a Taliban [[fighter]] in Afghanistan, and saw the cold breath as he spoke: realizing remote caves are actually very cold, Riva placed an air conditioning system in the set.	Amb,Male
4067	In the second season, [[Ai]] becomes more expressive and shows more emotions, being more willing to interact with her "[[clients]]" and [[victims]].	Female,Amb,Amb
4068	[[Pulcheria]] also provided all the instruction necessary for [[Theodosius]] to be a successful emperor when he would come of age.	Amb,Male
4069	[[Madonna]] later obtained permit to shoot inside the palace of the [[Marquis]] of Salvatierra.	Amb,Amb
4070	In 1973, the WSFS removed the category for Best Professional Magazine, and a Best Professional [[Editor]] award was instated as its replacement, in order to recognize "the increasing importance of original anthologies".	Amb
4071	They are designed with a hinged flap that is adjustable to help shade the eyes of [[drivers]] and [[passengers]] from the glare of sunlight.	Amb,Amb

4074	The screenplay concerns a cabaret [[singer]] and a British [[intelligence officer]] who travel to Berlin to rescue an atomic [[scientist]] being held there.	Amb,Amb,Amb
4075	The [[ambassador]] to a foreign other country has full authority over his [[countrymen]] there.	Male,Male
4076	This doctrine is widely advocated today on the grounds that, beyond the truth of [[God's]] existence, [[we]] can attain to no certain religious knowledge; and that, since God has left us thus in uncertainty, He will be pleased with whatever form of worship we sincerely offer Him.	Male,Amb
4077	After the competition, the [[singer]] uploaded a vlog in her YouTube official account, stating that there would be no music video for the song, since the performances were very expensive to make and costed a lot.	Female
4078	[[She]] grew up in a show business [[family]]: her [[parents]] are former professional actors and her older sister, [[Kaitlin]], is also an actress.	Female,Amb,Male,Female
4079	His other wartime roles included a spell as [[editor]] of Paris-Soir in 1941, service on the general secretariat of Milice from 1942 and a series of written works for a variety of journals, including Combats, the militant journal of [[Henry Charbonneau]].	Male,Amb

5622	[[I]] also welcome the comments made by the Commission President, Mr [[Prodi]].	Amb,Male
5623	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], Mr [[Savary]], firstly [[we]] should do this without a debate, but it is good to have a debate so as to spend some time highlighting all that has gone well.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb
5624	[[I]] am convinced that, if such a brutal form of mutilation as this had been forced upon our male fellow [[Members]], the issue would have been resolved long ago.	Amb,Male

5626	[[I]] agree wholeheartedly with what Commissioner [[Verheugen]] said about the candidate countries having done their duty over recent years, but it is the fault of certain of our Member States that [[we]] in the European Union have failed to do what had to be done.	Amb,Amb,Amb

7239	[[We]] are also deeply concerned about the closure of the newspaper Pagonya, already mentioned by two [[Members]] of [[Parliament]], and the sentencing of its [[editor]] and one of his [[collaborators]], as well as the charges against the [[editor]] of Rabochy.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
7240	Once this regulation is approved, immigration liaison [[officers]] posted to third countries must form effective networks for cooperation at local or regional level on the basis of the positive precedent set by the network established in the Western Balkans at the initiative of the United Kingdom and which has shown positive results in regulating immigration from that region to the States of the European Union.	Amb
7241	[[I]] fully welcome the proposals on harmonisation of maximum residue levels in foodstuffs throughout the European Union.	Amb
7242	. Having praised Mr [[Rocard]] for his excellent report, [[I]] would like to take this opportunity to mention the importance of that annual European scheme which puts a European city in the spotlight in the name of culture.	Male,Amb
7243	Yesterday [[I]] said that I am determined to have a greater proportion of women [[Commissioners]] than has been the case up to now, but a number of women [[Members]] have asked me today exactly what my objective is.	Amb,Female,Female
7244	[[I]] do not understand how the Commission’s clever Swedish [[Vice-President]] can put her name to a communications strategy that will impose a particular view of the Constitution upon [[people]].	Amb,Female,Amb

Male,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
7249	[[I]] am pleased for my [[colleagues]], but I worry about the [[people]] of Kazakhstan, where the current elected [[Parliament]] does not include a single opposition [[member]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
7250	Finally, let [[me]] place on record that the relative peace [[we]] have today in Northern Ireland is primarily due not to some EU peace programme but to the remarkable tenacity, courage and sacrifice of our marvellous security [[forces]], who faced down the [[IRA]] which robbed us of peace for so long.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
7251	[[I]] suspect that Mr [[Sarkozy]] would describe himself, following this experience of the financial crisis, as a Keynesian.	Amb,Male

7254	Today, there was a report in a Dutch newspaper about an asparagus [[farmer]] who was taken into custody because she was suspected of human trafficking and of using slave labour by [[Romanians]], in other words, European citizens.	Female,Amb
7255	[[I]] deeply regret the fact that the [[Vice-President]] of the Commission and the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy is not here, because it is she who chairs the Foreign Affairs Council and who ought to attend debates on foreign policy.	Amb,Female
7256	The disregard for [[women]] has reached peak levels when a German [[judge]] refers to the [[husband's]] right of procreation as a decisive factor in her judgment in a Muslim divorce case.	Female,Female,Male
7257	The Member States must ratify and implement this convention and recommendations quickly, because its implementation would address the needs of one of the most vulnerable categories of [[worker]] and would tackle the problem of undeclared work.	Amb
7258	There is a need for all [[citizens]] to be made aware of these effective measures.	Amb
7259	[[I]] call Mrs [[Green]] to open the debate on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.	Amb,Female
7260	The assisting [[spouse]] deserves more than just recognition from her [[husband]] and [[family]].	Female,Male,Amb
7261	[[I]] have no doubt that Mr [[Bangemann]] will pass that on to Mr [[Marín]].	Amb,Male,Male
7262	Certainly, there is no question of depriving the [[artist]] of a genuine resale right over his work: the resale right is a way of letting the artist benefit from the added value which his work gains over time and providing him with an appropriate and uniform level of protection.	Male
7263	My [[constituent]] runs a small business which happens to contain all women [[employees]].	Amb,Female
7264	Madam [[President]], Mr [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], for years the subject of leghold traps has regularly featured on our agenda.	Female,Male,Female,Male
7265	Recently this has taken on an additional and very serious form. [[Women]] can no longer be treated by male [[doctors]], which has led to women dying in regions where there are no female [[doctors]].	Female,Male,Female

7268	Mrs [[Schleicher]] put forward an argument that might be difficult to sustain.	Female
7269	[[We]] should remember that, when President-in-Office of the Council, the Luxembourg minister Mr [[Junker]] commented that the policies of weakening and creating uncertainty in contractual employment relations result in an increase in the number of accidents at work. He also said that uncertainty is the working condition which most seriously threatens the health and safety of [[workers]].	Amb,Male,Amb
7270	[[We]] should insist that Mr [[Cook]] is brought before this House to provide us with an explanation on his extraordinary collaboration with the oppressive Indonesian regime.	Amb,Male

7277	The difference between the two is that it refers to three persons: an [[actor]], and two other [[actors]] or goals.	Amb,Amb
7278	Immediately, [[he]] put [[her]] in a studio owned by a [[friend]].	Male,Female,Amb
7279	This intuition, based on her experience as an [[interpreter]], was more akin to the conclusions of psychological and cognitive studies of language, which were also beginning to break this new ground at the time.	Female
7280	During a Thanksgiving dinner held inside the house, her [[father]] accuses her of being the [[killer]].	Male,Female

7284	Several major figures such as [[Galileo]] and [[René Descartes]] completely ignored [[Kepler's]] Astronomia nova.	Amb,Amb,Amb
7285	It was a decision that, along with the network's desire to attract more male [[viewers]], would have serious repercussions for the show's continued survival.	Male

7288	[[Shepherd]] admits drinking alcohol again, and [[King]] offers to take her to [[Alcoholics]] Anonymous meetings.	Female,Male,Amb

7312	The robust [[model]] and the minimal [[model]] also disagree over how to classify moral subjectivism (roughly, the view that moral facts are not mind-independent in the relevant sense, but that moral statements may still be true).	Amb,Amb

7320	On the other hand, huge woodlands owned by the [[monarch]] and his [[kin]] remained outside of the system of castle districts.	Male,Amb
7321	[[Others]] have argued that social organization theory is inadequate because it cannot account for some homosexual behaviors, for example, [[penguin]] species where male [[individuals]] mate for life and refuse to pair with [[females]] when given the chance.	Amb,Amb,Male,Female

10236	Madam [[President]], [[I]] clearly owe Mr [[Wurtz]] an explanation, and I am going give this explanation before the whole [[House]].	Female,Amb,Male,Amb
10237	The [[chancellor]] of the media, as he is called at home, made his entrance and what came out of the final declaration adopted hours later was obviously a matter of indifference to him.	Male
10238	Yesterday, the Commonwealth [[Secretary-General]] said that it is still possible to have free elections.	Amb
10239	Of all the [[speakers]], Mrs [[Diamantopoulou]] made the very effective point that words can be cheap in the question of anti-racism.	Female,Female
10240	In that respect, our [[rapporteur]] also deserves credit for proposing a very exhaustive list of the approaches and measures that can and must be adopted.	Amb
10241	The proposed Charter is unique in the way it gives a central place to the [[citizen]] and her rights.	Female
10242	Unfortunately, there are also female [[politicians]] who just cannot be relied upon, even when it comes to putting more female [[candidates]] on the electoral lists.	Female,Female
10243	[[I]] believe that [[we]] are also currently committed to a political solution which will bring stability to Afghanistan, and it is notable that, when a [[person]] who could establish a degree of mediation in Afghanistan, the exiled ex-king in Rome, proposed the calling of a Grand Assembly, the Loya Jirga, which could bring the various [[tribes]] together, he did so together with American [[congressmen]], but we were not involved, although the Community troika has visited more or less the whole region.	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb,Male
10244	Rest assured, this is something that [[I]] regret, as [[we]] had 16 female [[speakers]] to just one male [[speaker]].	Amb,Amb,Female,Male
10245	[[I]] want to end by thanking, in particular, the Commissioner, Mrs [[Diamantopoulou]], and her [[staff]], the Belgian Presidency and Mrs [[Onkelinx]].	Amb,Female,Amb,Female
10246	A number of [[speakers]] - Mrs [[Villiers]], in particular - have also mentioned the value of transparency in the state aid register too.	Female,Female
10247	The [[majority]] in [[Parliament]] are free to desire 'an intelligent and flexible application of the Pact in the manner proposed by the [[Commission]]', or to support it when it arbitrarily initiates accusatory proceedings against Member States that cannot conform to a zealous interpretation of the provisions of the Stability Pact, but personally, [[I]] cannot go down that road.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10248	What [[I]] say to the [[Americans]] I say as one who thinks of himself as one of their friends, urging them to understand our position, which is founded on the rule of law and on human dignity, that every human [[being]] is of equal worth, whatever the colour of their skin, their gender, or their nationality.	Male,Amb,Amb
10249	[[They]] have an overwhelming responsibility for having ruined Africa through the trafficking of [[slaves]], through colonialist pillaging and then through another form of pillaging, which continues today.	Amb,Amb
10250	In this regard it is imperative to remove the farcical rule that says that a [[doctor]] is working when he is asleep in bed purely because, technically, he is on call – but then, common sense is not a capability that this [[Parliament]] often utilises.	Male,Amb
10251	As regards the composition of the [[Commission]], [[I]] do not think that the questions to the Council aimed at ensuring that there should be enough women [[Commissioners]], are actually very much help at this present time.	Amb,Amb,Female
10252	As [[I]] said earlier, there are 90 directives concerned with the safety of automobiles and these directives are policed, if [[you]] like, by the Member States.	Amb,Amb
10253	A Commission [[official]] said something telling to [[us]] when we questioned her on this in [[committee]].	Female,Amb,Amb
10254	[[I]] shall not dwell on what the main priorities are, as they have already been mentioned: terrorism requires a broad, non-emergency, prevention and reaction strategy, which must certainly respect [[people’s]] fundamental rights; personal data protection initiatives will be formally submitted very soon, and in the second half of the year there will also be a comprehensive data protection initiative under the third pillar, as I promised this [[Parliament]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
10255	[[I]] would also like, speaking on behalf of this House, to express the same solidarity with the German [[citizen]] and her [[son]], both of whom were abducted in Iraq in February.	Amb,Female,Male
10256	[[We]] also know that the rate of HIV among male [[prisoners]] is 15 times higher than among the general [[population]].	Amb,Male,Amb
10257	A number of [[Members]] of the European Parliament, amongst others Mr [[Schulz]], Mr [[Meyer-Pleite]], Mr [[Liese]], Mr [[dos Santos]] and several others, regretfully [[I]] cannot mention them all, have mentioned the Cuban issue.	Male,Male,Male,Male,Male,Amb
10258	(DE) Mr [[President]], [[we]] are debating how to preserve biological diversity for the next [[generation]], yet at the same time we are adopting measures which are completely counterproductive.	Male,Amb,Amb
10259	[[He]] is a very well-known [[writer]] and journalist and has been running, amongst other things, a German-Government-funded website called 'Outreach' promoting peace and justice.	Male,Male

10261	[[He]] hugged [[me]], kissed me and said: "Please, [[mama]], go!”	Male,Female,Female
10262	[[I]] would add that Brazil has been increasingly active in cooperation with the Portuguese-speaking countries of the South and in Africa and could therefore cooperate actively in this sector with the European Union.	Amb
10263	(NL) [[Madam President]], [[I]] should like to thank the [[Commissioner]] for her contribution so far.	Female,Amb,Female
10264	[[Patient]] safety has to be the priority when dealing with medications.	Amb
10265	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to ask Mr [[Bloom]] just how his diatribe was received at Cambridge.	Male,Amb,Male
10266	The Commission [[Delegation]] and the [[Heads of]] Missions of Member States, in close contact with the International Committee of the Red Cross, are monitoring very closely the situation of certain [[prisoners]], such as Mr [[Abera Yemane Ab]].	Amb,Amb,Male,Male
10267	[[I]] certainly agree with the [[rapporteur]] when he expresses satisfaction with the spirit of constructive cooperation which has been established between the [[Commission]] and the Court of [[Auditors]], and when he notes that the Court of Auditors' control of the consolidated income and expenditure account has improved since 1994.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
10268	A [[teacher]] recently informed [[me]] that in her class [[children]] were able to access [[adult]] material the minute her back was turned.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
10269	[[I]] wish Mr [[Arafat]], Mr [[Netanyahu]], the [[Palestinians]] and the [[Israelis]] wisdom, political courage and vision.	Amb,Male,Male,Amb,Amb
10270	This proposal was put forward by the [[Commission]] as part of the so-called 'Monti package' which, as [[colleagues]] will recall, is designed to implement the approach to fiscal coordination proposed by the Commission, and fully backed by [[Parliament]]. It is an attempt to steer the Member States' taxation systems in directions that are compatible with the smooth functioning of the internal market, averting the adverse effects of so-called harmful tax competition.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10271	[[We]] worked together for many long hours, and came to know her as a [[friend]]. We valued the personal dignity, common sense and spirit of solidarity that always characterised her work and are very sorry that events should have taken such a turn.	Amb,Female
10272	And that begins at the very top, in the leadership of the Council of [[Ministers]]: all those male [[leaders]] who are not taking it seriously.	Male,Male
10273	Mr [[President]], following the excellent interventions by Mr [[Souchet]] and Mr [[Martinez]] on maintaining the French ban on British beef, [[I]] would just like to add three observations, from the legal, moral and political points of view.	Male,Male,Male,Amb
10274	Well, Berlin has confirmed that principle, and without daring to admit it, naturally, [[they]] have sided with Mrs [[Thatcher]].	Amb,Female
10275	But [[I've]] come across some glaring errors at BoxRec, mostly in the historical records."	Amb
10276	Unfortunately her dreams did not come true for unknown reasons and [[she]] became an art [[teacher]].	Female,Female
10277	According to the account, Dr. [[No]] shot the [[agent]] in his right eye during a mission.	Male,Male
10278	The [[officer]] testing his new model rifle on seven-year-old [[children]] had done his duty well, and in open parliament the [[premier]] offered him his congratulation.	Male,Amb,Male
10279	[[Harper]] also kept [[Adam's]] swordstick, and both remain on his wall at home to this day.	Male,Amb

10282	"[[I]] was too young to understand the role," she said, "but if [[you've]] been cast in a film by a famous [[director]], no matter how well you did, other less-famous [[directors]] will also want to cast you."	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
10283	It is now common to distinguish between the legacy and influence of [[Marx]] specifically and the legacy and influence of [[those]] who shaped his ideas for political purposes.	Male,Amb
10284	There are further submodes, making for a complicated system, one to which nearly all male [[musicians]] conform.	Male
10285	If an insufficient number of packets are being sent, there are ways for an [[attacker]] to send packets on the network and thereby stimulate reply packets which can then be inspected to find the key.	Amb
10286	The presiding [[officer]] and chief pastor of each synod is a bishop.	Male
10287	For the Islam Channel, [[he]] is the [[writer]] and presenter of the political history series Timeline and a presenter of The Report programme.	Male,Male
10288	His last words were: "[[I]] killed the [[President]] because he was the enemy of the good [[people]] – the good working people.	Male,Male,Amb
10289	[[Ace]] also became the focus of a dedicated character arc that was seeded from her introduction onwards and prominently played out during Season 26.	Female
10290	In this, [[Plato]] carefully phrases three axiomatic restrictions on action or reaction: 1) in the same part, 2) in the same relation, 3) at the same time.	Amb

10293	When [[Mystique]] was introduced to [[Azazel]], whom [[Christian]] knew as a business partner, she had an instant attraction to him.	Female,Male,Female
10294	The act granted many new powers to the office, including the powers to manage its own budgets, to provide advanced training in all fields of the society, and to confer certificates upon the [[trainees]].	Amb
10295	Under Pennsylvania state law at the time, any state [[employee]] who learned about suspected [[child]] abuse was required to report the incident to his immediate [[supervisor]].	Male,Amb,Amb

10430	In a process in which, since Seattle, there is great social interest, it appears essential to emphasise the role that democratic [[Parliaments]] must play as an expression of the [[citizens’]] views within international fora such as the WTO and, in the case of this Parliament, as a body responsible for democratic control of the Union’s trade policy and a future co-legislator in this field, once the European Constitution enters into force.

Amb,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
10438	The reasons for this are clear: [[we]] are living in the space of a single global civilisation in which the [[owner]] of a Greenland fishing company may live in Taiwan and also own part of a bank in Brazil or the [[owner]] of a Czech mine may manage his company by computer from Iceland.

10440	If the Second World War was the impetus for the post-war political modernisation of Western Europe, having become the logical conclusion of the relatively short period of domination by the Nazi regime in Germany, then for the USSR and Russia, the need for reconstruction was dictated by the experience of 70 years of domination by the Communist regime, the culmination of which was [[Stalin's]] terrorist dictatorship.

10447	At this late - or indeed early hour, [[I]] would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs [[Junker]], whose appraisal of the present regulation has clearly set out the objectives and requirements of development cooperation from a [[woman's]] viewpoint.	Amb,Female,Female
10448	Because the terms under which the [[candidate]] countries are able to meet the conditions for membership vary, some kind of selection takes place automatically.	Amb
10449	First of all, the [[Commission]] has clearly stated that whatever proposals may be made about income subsidies, the average [[farmer]] and grower will always prefer to derive his income from the market rather than by filling in all sorts of forms to obtain a subsidy.	Amb,Male
10450	Young male [[drivers]], for example, face insurance costs at least twice as high as in other European countries, and that is on top of the higher car prices in Ireland anyway.	Male
10451	These principles, together with the demand made in Mr [[Grosch's]] report for a clear definition of working time in the road transport sector, which should include all the time when a [[worker]] is at his [[employer's]] disposal, and the confirmation of the role to be played by the public services, should help to promote a progressive approach to the construction of Europe with technical progress and know-how being used to ensure the advance of civilisation. This involves using [[everyone's]] skills but without opposing existing diversity, which would bring everyone down to the lowest common denominator.	Male,Male,Amb,Amb
10452	If [[we]] are to discuss global economic guidelines shortly, the national [[governments]] - and perhaps the [[Commission]] could tell us how it intends to encourage them to do so - need to ensure that they come up with structural plans to make [[employers]], [[workers]] and [[governments]] face up to their responsibilities and decide on a plan together, rather than having it imposed on them by the government.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10453	That is the universal feeling in the [[Commission]], which is why my colleague, Mr [[Van Miert]], and his [[associates]] in the Commission specifically sought to do something effective about preventing for all time in the future and indeed for 1998 the use of discriminatory practices by [[CFO]].	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
10454	But the problem you are now confronted with is that whilst, as a [[politician]], you obviously have to act when the going is good, you also of course have to ask the question as to what will actually happen next once a country has been granted candidate status.	Amb

10616	The information problem, which Mr [[Bonde]] just referred to, is treated like a straw in the wind, with the [[Commission]] seeming to restrict information to us, as [[citizens]] and as parliamentarians, although we have the right to it under the Treaties.	Male,Amb,Amb
10617	[[I]] appreciate this, but I asked one of my [[employees]] to look at the agricultural section, and in an hour he had prepared a complete report on which countries were concerned, on what problems there were and also on how much money had gone missing.	Amb,Male
10618	[[I]] was reflecting on the very good point, amongst others, that Mr [[van Hulten]] made earlier on, seeking the explanation for the fact that the [[House]], including myself, had the delight of listening to a lengthy foreign affairs debate earlier on.	Amb,Male,Amb
10619	Moving on to the next question, [[I]] would say to Mrs [[Thors]] - I think it was her that asked me - that we in the [[Commission]] are prepared to review the current Interinstitutional Agreement. It is more accurate to call it an exchange of letters than an Interinstitutional Agreement, since that is what has governed the petitions procedure since 1989.	Amb,Female,Amb
10620	[[We]] simply have to look at what King [[Abdullah]] of Jordan, who we all know to be a clearly moderate leader, said the day before yesterday – and [[I]] quote, ‘the assassination of [[Sheikh Yassin]], a week before the Arab League Summit, demonstrates that the [[Israelis]] wanted the meeting to fail and for the Arabs not to be able to relaunch their dialogue initiative, because Israel does not want peace’.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
10621	[[I]] would like briefly to refer to Mr [[Mote’s]] comments: he might be a bit more sanguine about the health and safety regulations if he had once had to gather up the remains of an unfortunate [[worker]] who had slipped off a roof and ended up dead on the street below because there was no scaffolding available during his work, and had then to go to the [[family]] of that unfortunate man and explain why he was dead.	Amb,Male,Male,Amb
10622	I think that this joint declaration by the three institutions is a good idea, Mrs [[Wallström]], firstly because it marks the symbolic anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, which were the starting point for the Community, but also because it means that the [[Council]], the [[Commission]] and [[Parliament]] want to put forward proposals together for a way out of the situation of the Constitutional Treaty.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
10623	Can the [[Council]] confirm that [[citizens]] of other EU Member States use this clinic for abortions even after the 30th week of pregnancy, evading the criminal law of their own Member State?	Amb,Female
10624	[[I]] think Mrs [[Gutiérrez-Cortines]] has done an absolutely fantastic job and I will support her totally if this House decides not to reject it, but I shall briefly mention something that Mrs [[Scheele]] and Mrs [[Corbey]] said on erosion.	Amb,Female,Female,Female
10625	Mr [[Corbett]] has made the essential point: this is not about the Consolidated Treaty, it is about the contents of the Reform Treaty.	Male
10626	The truth is that the Treaty provides a framework for a future [[we]] have yet to sketch, a future where the biggest single challenge for our Union, as Sweden's Europe [[Minister]] says, is delivering the practical results which [[citizens]] rightly demand and not the interminable naval gazing, which a Conseil des sages will simply prolong.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10627	It is therefore of fundamental importance that [[we]] protect ourselves using temporary campaigns such as those initiated by Mrs [[Záborská]] during the 2006 football World Cup, which also deserve to be continued this time.	Amb,Female
10628	It was quite a battle, Mrs [[De Sarnez]], because not all the countries were in agreement about that, just to finance major projects, and in all honesty [[I]] must say that the [[Commission]] was a lot more ambitious than some Member States.	Female,Amb,Amb
10629	(DE) Madam [[President]], Mr [[Farage]] claimed this morning that [[I]] had said, in this House, that 'a "no” vote will lead to fascism'.	Female,Male,Amb
10630	[[He]] is now [[Chair]] of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, and, when he writes a report saying that the European Union needed its own armed [[forces]], then [[we]] can be confident that that is precisely what the European Union intends to bring about in due course.	Male,Male,Amb,Amb
10631	[[Vice-President]] of the Commission. - (DE) Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs [[Roth-Behrendt]], and her two shadow rapporteurs, Mrs [[Ries]] and Mrs [[Grossetête]], for their constructive and intensive collaboration, which helped [[us]] to reach consensus at first reading.	Amb,Male,Female,Male,Female,Female,Female,Amb
10632	This used to be perfectly OK when [[we]] had massive surpluses - milk lakes, butter mountains and beef mountains - and were required to distribute this food to the [[poor]], using the CAP budget to finance that distribution.	Amb,Amb
10633	[[I]] would like to congratulate my fellow member, Mrs [[Buitenweg]], for her report, which opens up the way to supplementing the legal structure for eliminating all forms of discrimination.	Amb,Female
10634	[[I]] would like to thank Prime Minister [[Fischer]] for the masterful way in which he rejected this, went to the Brussels Summit himself and successfully concluded this Council Presidency.	Amb,Male
10635	[[I]] understand that, for the additional two posts which remain to be filled, the High [[Representative]] and Vice-President of the Commission and the President of the Council, only [[men's]] names are being circulated.	Amb,Male,Male
10636	The [[CEO]] of Irish Nationwide has ridden off into the sunset with millions in his back pocket while [[taxpayers]] have had their wages reduced dramatically.	Male,Amb
10637	Some banks engage in financial speculation, but fortunately, [[we]] still have a banking network where the [[manager]] knows the [[businessman]] who goes to ask for credit, and so he can trust him, and also knows that the money he invests will be reinvested in the bank, and that what happened in the United States will not happen here.	Amb,Male,Male
10638	[[I]] am asking the [[Commission]] to strive to ensure this and to punish, and not just timidly criticise, any State which fails to meet this obligation.	Amb,Amb
10639	Some [[women's]] lives could have been saved if their appeals for help had been heeded, and this shows that the problem of violence against women is related not only to domestic situations made difficult by marginalization or poverty (there is violence against women in all social classes), but also to deep-rooted social values which make allowances for the [[attacker]].	Female,Amb
10640	Our activities so far reach from open letters to Commissioner [[Fischler]], through collecting signatures and action days, to blockades of sensitive border crossings; because in Austria there is a special situation arising from Austria's [[Animal]] Transport Law.	Amb,Amb
10641	The amendment tabled by the [[rapporteur]] does not specify the point at which the [[operator]] is released from his obligations and does not therefore improve on the current situation.	Amb,Male

13119	The second key element of the report concerns the matter [[I]] had occasion to highlight months ago to the Italian [[Ambassador]] himself, even before [[anyone]] else, for it is primarily an Italian issue: the incompatibility between holding the office of [[Member]] of the European Parliament, on the one hand, and that of member of a national parliament, regional councillor or - I would add sotto voce, calling on Mr [[Napolitano]] to take note of the fact - mayor of a big city, on the other.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Male
13120	The main effect of streamlining procedures would be to do away with subsidies to intermediary [[bodies]]. These bodies aim to help [[artists]] and [[students]] to benefit from the much vaunted European funds but some of them are actually chaired by [[Members]] of the House.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
13121	The [[Commission]] communication, which [[I]] consider to be extremely positive, follows the consultation process launched by the Commission in 2000 on 'Acting locally for employment?, which involved a large number of [[actors]] at European, national and local levels and confirmed the opinion that [[Parliament]] had expressed on a number of occasions in the past.

Amb,Female,Amb,Female,Female
13132	And that is exactly what the [[Goldstone]] report has done - although it was not just Mr Goldstone, it was also his two female [[colleagues]].	Male,Female
13133	In this context, it is important not to forget the severe physical and mental stresses suffered by the [[relatives]] who care for these sick [[people]].	Amb,Amb
13134	The [[reporter]] - and the Legal Affairs [[Committee]] agrees with him - advocates a directive, because the Member States can apply that more flexibly.	Male,Amb

13136	As a [[member]] of the Committee on Petitions, I cannot but pay tribute to the work of the [[Ombudsman's]] office and its contribution to a process that seeks to bring the [[citizens]] of our nations closer to European institutions that seem all too remote from them.	Amb,Amb,Amb

13140	This year alone the [[agency]] finds itself ECU 4m overspent and the [[Director]] risks finding himself operating from an illegal position. The [[Commission]] has started proceedings for a transfer, but the lateness of the transfer will mean there will still be some difficulties.	Amb,Male,Amb
13141	[[I]] will very briefly say to Mr [[Katiforis]] - whom I cannot see here at the moment - that I in fact believe that it would be a serious mistake at this time of international economic fragility for the European Union to lift protectionist barriers. This could provoke similar responses all over the world and lead [[us]] into a global recession that could last for a long time.	Amb,Male,Amb
13142	The [[Commission's]] role is to initiate and execute, and [[Parliament's]] role is to monitor. This strengthened relationship must be an essential component of the Union's institutional structure, and should benefit, in particular, transparency and legislative issues.	Amb,Amb
