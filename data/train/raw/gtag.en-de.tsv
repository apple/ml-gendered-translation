80	Any [[child]] who is failing is expressing his unease in the educational institution, but also in [[society]].	Male,Amb
81	However, it pained [[me]] to do so, Mr [[President]], for the issue raised by these States is right and proper, and I wonder why [[we]] are waiting to regulate the border control procedures at Europe's frontiers with a directive which would be immediately applicable throughout the European territory.	Amb,Male,Amb
82	Even as the [[Council]] sits here and - if [[I]] might say even with due deference to all the politeness of the [[Minister]] - throws the book at [[us]] and says, "There is a treaty; there is a procedure.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
83	Madam [[President]], since Mr [[Barón Crespo]] has recently been so obsessed with receiving all sorts of regulations, [[I]] would also ask you to send him the regulations on the questions that [[Members]] put to the European Commission, and he should not be surprised that the answer was received by the [[person]] who asked the question.	Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
84	Clearly, the most potentially controversial issue in this [[Haug]] report relates to [[Parliament' s]] support for the possibility of opening a debate on the establishment of a direct [[Community]] tax which would be a source of autonomous funding for the Community budget.	Amb,Amb,Amb
85	In this connection, Mr [[President]], [[I]] think it is worth mentioning that, even in this institution, far more zeal than usual is displayed in asking one of our German [[colleagues]] for her card. It so happens that the [[lady]] is of Kurdish descent, with a dark complexion and black eyes and therefore does not look like the average [[Member]].	Male,Amb,Female,Female,Amb

90	[[I]] would also ask the [[Commission]] to investigate the possibilities of [[adult]] education in the sector and whether a general diploma might also be required to move on to the next stages of the technology.	Amb,Amb,Amb
91	There are three possible explanations: either the [[Commission]] gave OLAF’s [[director]] completely fatuous instructions, with the result that he did not keep the Commission informed; or the Commission wished to leave unpleasant matters on the back burner for years in a secretive OLAF; or OLAF’s [[management]] is appallingly naive and does not understand the political necessity of sounding the alarm bells so that the Commission is warned of serious fraud.	Amb,Male,Amb
92	[[They]] had the sense, the decency and the foresight and, [[I]] suppose, the resources to treat a disabled [[person]] as a real person.	Amb,Amb,Amb

96	It is true that Poland is home to five million [[families]] who have to survive on the equivalent of EUR 2.5 per [[person]] per day, but EUR 2.5 in Poland is significantly more than EUR 2.5 in the poorest countries of the world.	Amb,Amb
97	As Mr [[Michel]] has said, it is clear that free elections must be held in Lebanon without any type of pressure, and we in our political [[group]] are pleased with the [[Commissioner’s]] comments to the effect that a technical mission is going to be sent to Lebanon with a view to preparing a European Union mission of electoral [[observers]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
98	With that contribution, he gives [[us]] evidence that he is an [[expert]] on political folly.	Amb,Male
99	For example, Mr [[McCreevy]] declared at a conference in London that it must never be forgotten that the single market is far and away the project that goes furthest in terms of deregulating the European Union.	Male
100	– The next item is the report (A6-0318/2005) by Mrs [[Martens]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on Development, on a development strategy for Africa [2005/2142(INI)].	Female,Amb
101	In contrast to preceding years, there was also scarcely any reduction in unemployment, and so [[I]] call on the [[Commission]] to commission, as soon as possible, a study examining [[worker]] migration and all the effects associated with it, and doing so in a value-free way.	Amb,Amb,Amb
102	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would like to thank you – and Mrs [[Niebler]] in particular – most warmly for this debate, and also say how appreciative I am of the participation in it of so many [[men]], that is to say, of your House’s male [[Members]].

104	He is a good, old [[friend]] and was a colleague of [[mine]] when I used to have a real job.	Male,Amb
105	[[I]] therefore welcome the fact that the amendments [[we]] agreed on, which were the result of a broad consensus among the various [[groups]] represented in Parliament and of close collaboration between the [[rapporteur]] and the shadow [[rapporteurs]], were adopted almost unanimously by the [[committee]], with just one abstention.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
106	(PT) Mr [[President]], [[I]] should like to table an amendment that has been agreed with our rapporteur, Mrs [[Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou]].	Male,Amb,Female
107	[[author]]. - (PL) Mr [[President]], the development of international humanitarian law, together with the establishment of courts to try [[perpetrators]] of war crimes and crimes against humanity represented a mayor achievement by the international [[community]] after the Second World War.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
108	By the same token [[I]] do not agree with the argument of the report's [[author]] that the production of bio fuels could result in an increase in food prices and that it will therefore be necessary to open the EU market to food coming from third countries.	Amb,Amb
109	[[I]] and my fellow [[Vice-Presidents]] who have responsibility for Question Time are always open to ways in which we can improve it and do better, hence the step that we have taken already of inviting [[Members]] to come to the front of the Chamber.	Amb,Amb,Amb
110	On the other hand, Germany's economy [[minister]] threatens that his country will not let the EU Commission dictate decisions in the backrooms in Brussels.	Male
111	In his explanatory statement the [[rapporteur]] argues that this limit is being introduced to prevent so-called abuse of the right of [[Members]] to ask questions.	Male,Amb
112	Mrs [[Gill]], [[I]] think that, especially since this afternoon, I am beginning to learn Rule 149 by heart. You are referring to paragraph 5.	Female,Amb
113	[[I]] also remember the [[statesmen]], the [[heads]] of state and government who were determined, convinced and courageous Europeans and who are today represented by Mr [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]].	Amb,Male,Male,Male
114	The [[Commission]] therefore welcomes the report by Mr [[Schröder]] and will provide a detailed reaction to the points raised in due course.	Amb,Male
115	Every day, 72 million [[children]] - mainly [[girls]] - do not go to school.	Female,Female
116	In this regard [[I]] would like to thank the [[rapporteur]] for her excellent work.	Amb,Female
117	[[I]] would like to point out that the A to G scale, which [[we]] all consider to be very successful and recognisable and to have made a huge contribution towards energy savings, obviously has problems which, Mr [[Reul]], I listed in my opening comments; in other words, this scale needs to be updated.	Amb,Amb,Male
118	[[author]]. - Madam [[President]], can I say, as a gay [[man]], I am proud that this [[House]] and [[others]] are speaking out against this proposed law.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
119	In the absence of a [[deputy]], equally double-hatted, the [[High Representative]] will more and more have to choose between staying in Brussels and being present, for instance, at the European Parliament, and flying to a foreign capital, where the EU needs equally high representation.	Amb,Amb
120	[[We]] must not forget, however, that efforts for the good of the [[child]] come first.	Amb,Amb
121	(LT) Madam [[President]], [[I]] would like to congratulate my fellow [[Member]] and thank her for her cooperation in preparing this important report.	Female,Amb,Female

125	Much as [[I]] value the work that the [[rapporteur]] has done, there is one point on which I do not share her opinion.	Amb,Female
126	Mrs [[Green]] referred to 'a potential [[successor']] , not to the [[President-elect]].	Female,Amb,Amb
127	Last night in the House of Commons Mr [[Hogg]] said that it would be an abnegation of British sovereignty for him to give evidence to [[us]] here.	Male,Amb
128	Mrs [[Baldi]] would like to speak.	Female
129	The next item is the debate on the report (A4-0241/97) by Mr [[Virgin]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Regulation establishing common rules and procedures to apply to shipments to certain non-OECD countries of certain types of waste (COM(94)0678 - C4-0048/97-95/0029(SYN)).	Male,Amb
130	[[I]] would like to draw your attention, Madam [[Minister]], [[Commissioner]], to certain issues included in the [[Martens]] report which the draft communication from the [[Commission]] to the [[Council]] overlooked but which [[Parliament]] would like to insist upon.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
131	[[Colleague]], let [[me]] interrupt you.	Amb,Amb
132	When a [[citizens]] stands as an MEP he should accept the salary on offer.	Male
133	To this end, the [[Commission]] will draw up a questionnaire and issue it to the [[groups]] concerned; it will investigate the aspects raised by the honourable [[Member]] in her question, relating to the cost-effectiveness of applying the directive.	Amb,Amb,Female
134	[[I]] should like to welcome Sir [[Leon]] and ask him to reply to Mrs [[Ferrer's]] question.	Amb,Male,Female
135	[[I]] thank the [[rapporteur]].	Amb,Amb
136	[[I]] believe that is the reason why many conflicts of the past ten to fifteen years have been pursued by force of arms rather than before a [[tribunal]] or a criminal [[court]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
137	Madam [[President]], [[I]] concur with my colleague, Mr [[Ford]], that of course if [[we]] only sat in Brussels, we would not be here debating this building.	Female,Amb,Male,Amb
138	[[I]] understand, [[Madam President]], that there was one [[speaker]] in favour of the suggestion, and another [[speaker]], who has just resumed her seat, putting forward the idea that there should be a debate on this matter at the end of this month in the second October part-session.	Amb,Female,Amb,Female
139	That is why it is really good to hear that Mrs [[Wallström]] has ambitions for the years to come.	Female
140	Mr [[President]], Mr [[Wynn]] asked [[me]] three questions, which I briefly answered.	Male,Male,Amb
141	My personal comment is that [[I]] agree with Mrs [[Theorin]] that violence against [[women]] is the greatest individual violation of women' s rights.	Amb,Female,Female

217	It would in fact be more accurate to refer to a European Union-NAFTA agreement rather than an agreement associating the European Union with Mexico only.

223	The lack of transparency and the [[improvisation]] with which my country' s [[government]] is acting with regard to the crisis are, in my opinion, the reason for the massive drop in consumption in Spain, for which the [[cattle]] farming sector is paying.

356	As Mr [[Cashman]] explained, [[we]] question whether Amendment No 17 from the Verts/ALE Group it is admissible, and [[I]] welcome the fact that Mr [[MacCormick]] was doubtful about that.	Male,Amb,Amb,Male
357	As [[I]] see it, the authorisation directive is about harmonisation being a very positive thing, but also at the same time about the need to guarantee rights of access.	Amb
358	[[I]] also agree with Mr [[Moreira da Silva]] that the balance that has been achieved should be left alone, for, as many of my fellow [[Members]] have already said, Mrs [[Wallström]] and this [[Parliament]] have done some great work and, although it may be modest, the step forward is very significant.	Amb,Male,Amb,Female,Amb
359	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to thank Mr [[de Miguel]] and Commissioner [[Patten]] for their speeches, which have been very illuminating, but I believe [[we]] are missing the opportunity to analyse what is happening in Latin America and the role Europe can play.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
360	In response to the questions and comments made by Mrs [[Smet]], [[I]] fully endorse her view that [[women's]] policy and equal opportunities policy must flow into all policy areas.	Female,Amb,Female
361	In cases such as these it is, in fact, the [[people]] who need to take stock, by which [[I]] mean that it makes no difference to the people whether the violence is perpetrated by the [[warlords]] or the [[Taliban]].	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
362	[[I]] now wish in particular, however, to focus the [[Commissioner's]] attention on something he has already touched on here, which is how [[we]] might be able to get border cooperation to function more efficiently.	Amb,Male,Amb
363	The principle of gender mainstreaming must be clearly laid down in the new constitutional Treaty; this is one of my [[committee's]] main objectives in our fight to make the future Europe - and, we hope, the male [[members]] of the European Parliament - more aware of gender issues.	Amb,Male
364	But no, far from it, these proposals intend to make these social imbalances permanent and furthermore, Mr [[President]], [[they]] forget about the women [[farmers]] and agricultural [[workers]], who contribute so much to European agriculture.	Male,Amb,Female,Female
365	Finally, as far as the future of Europe is concerned, [[I]] absolutely agree with President [[Prodi]] that the Constitutional Treaty does indeed contain some very important and positive points; however, it also contains certain elements which give a great deal of cause for concern.	Amb,Amb
366	[[I]] hope, Madam [[Vice-President]], that you will shortly put before [[us]] a revised version of the rules on the charges for road use and that we will make distinctions along ecological lines as well.	Amb,Female,Amb
367	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], my [[group]] supports the report by Mr [[Perry]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Male
368	In short, it is high time that the [[Commission]] adopted the [[Council’s]] unanimous verdict and continued the experiment.	Amb,Amb
369	As Mr [[Bowe]] said, this is a very good and much-needed proposal and [[I]] welcome it.	Male,Amb
370	[[You]] will be aware that [[we]] are only at a preliminary stage in these negotiations, but [[I]] also have to tell you that we have sent a very strong signal to our [[partners]] by the publication, for the first time by the [[Commission]], and therefore by the entire European [[executive]], of a communication to the [[Council]] and [[Parliament]] on the European Union’s relations with UNESCO.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
371	Madam [[President]], [[I]] am glad that you, a lover of the coastline, are in charge of this sitting, and you know that.	Female,Amb
372	The best response [[I]] can offer on behalf of the Presidency is to quote directly to [[her]] the clear view of the June European [[Council]] on this matter: 'The European Council, while recognising the right of Israel to protect its [[citizens]] from attacks, remains concerned by the continuing construction of the separation barrier in the occupied Palestinian territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is contrary to the provisions of international law.'	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
373	How would you feel if you were the [[captain]] of a ship and you have a navigating [[officer]] joining you who is a lieutenant commander and a female?	Amb,Female
374	This is my profound belief, and the [[leader]] of the opposition will also have his role to play.	Male
375	- (LT) Madam [[Minister]], as a [[member]] of the delegation of the Subcommittee on Human Rights of the European Parliament, I have participated in the session of the Human Rights Council of the United Nations and have seen the Member States of the European Union negotiating their positions and trying to speak with one voice.	Female,Amb
376	Next, this statute will enable [[us]] significantly to enhance legal transparency and thus to build confidence among the various economic [[players]].	Amb,Amb
377	[[I]] have heard a number of [[speakers]], including Mrs [[Kaufmann]] and Mr [[Voggenhuber]], talk about things such as the national anthem, the title of Foreign Affairs [[Minister]] and the flag, as if these were Dutch issues.	Amb,Amb,Female,Male,Amb
378	A young [[person]] who drinks him or herself into oblivion, a pregnant [[women]] who damages her unborn [[child]] because of alcohol consumption, or a drunken [[driver]] who puts himself or [[others]] in danger: it is in precisely those areas that [[we]] need to act.	Amb,Female,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
379	When pesticides are even being found here and there in drinking water, it is undoubtedly high time to make the slow-grinding wheels of EU [[bureaucracy]] turn faster.	Amb
380	There are [[people]], now statesmen, who have been honoured guests in this Chamber, who have a past as freedom fighters.	Male
381	It is crucial that today's [[carers]], many of whom operate on a 24/7 basis, are not the next generation of older, poor [[people]].	Amb,Amb
382	Finally, [[I]] should like to thank Mrs [[Gill]], the rapporteur, for a very well prepared report.	Amb,Female
383	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs, Mr [[Saryusz-Wolski]] and Mr [[Kuhne]], for the constructive, comprehensive and future-oriented approach upon which both reports were based.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Male,Male
384	(BG) Mr. [[President]], the Bulgarian operational programmes within the framework of the EU funds were among the first to be approved by the [[Commission]] for the period from 2007 to 2013.	Male,Amb
385	In this respect, [[I]] must pay tribute to the work carried out by Commissioner [[Ferrero-Waldner]] and by the [[Commission]] in general in this area and in all aspects relating to the restoration of the rule of law.	Amb,Amb,Amb
386	This does not mean - because [[we]] have said so - that neither Georgia nor Ukraine have the right to become [[members]] of NATO.	Amb,Amb
387	Would it perhaps be possible for a debate to be conducted in the Czech Republic regarding what in fact [[they]] find troubling about this treaty and what alternatives President [[Klaus]] could offer the [[people]] of Europe to quell the current dissatisfaction, to which he indeed vociferously refers, and what solutions he would envision?	Amb,Male,Amb
388	Our deficit levels are at historic highs in several Member States, as the [[President]] of the Council has indicated.	Amb
389	From this perspective, [[I]] believe that the European Union and the European Parliament should act transparently and clearly, and as long as some [[Members]] feel that their votes have been treated by the voting equipment differently to the way they voted, and they did not have the possibility to check it on their monitors, then the vote will continue to be controversial.	Amb,Amb
390	Nevertheless, our expectations were exceeded: the Youth Parliament is made up of 68 female [[members]] and 62 male.	Female
391	Often, [[they]] are not given maternity leave in the full meaning of the word, but have to return to work as soon as possible.	Female
392	The stress which Mrs [[Van Brempt]] and her shadow [[rapporteurs]] have placed on efficient outdoor lighting for public infrastructure and, lastly, on the search for electricity storage solutions, is promising.	Female,Amb
393	[[I]] do not share the opinion of Mrs [[Trüpel]] that [[we]] have given way - quite the opposite!	Amb,Female,Amb
394	Mr [[President]], the question raised by Mrs [[Banotti]] and Mr [[Green]] and the associated resolution raise a specific human and legal problem that is of major concern, and [[I]] should therefore like to thank them for raising this question.	Male,Female,Male,Amb
395	As [[I]] said earlier, Mr [[Virgin]] is taking a 'green' stance on this issue, like a good environmental party man.	Amb,Male
396	Mr [[President]], Mr [[Commissioner]], it is an honour and a pleasure for [[me]] to take the floor to express the unalloyed support of the Group of the European People's Party for the guidelines established in this report by Mr [[Lehne]], rapporteur for the main [[committee]].	Male,Male,Amb,Male,Amb
397	Resale right seems to be a form of restitution to allow the [[author]] to profit from his work.	Male
398	Thank you, Mr [[Cushnahan]].	Male
399	[[I]] remember that the Colombian [[Minister]] for Foreign Affairs displayed before this Parliament her [[government's]] commitment to combating the impunity there and to arresting all [[those]] who encourage and promote the actions of the paramilitary [[organizations]].	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
400	Mr [[President]], first of all [[I]] wish to congratulate Mr [[Marset Campos]] and the whole [[committee]] on an excellent decision.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb
401	[[Ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], the Foreign Affairs [[Committee]] has tabled three amendments to its own motion for a resolution, in order to take account of what Commissioner Sir [[Leon Brittan]] said here yesterday evening in the debate about the European Parliament's involvement in international agreements concluded under the Euratom Treaty.

491	As the [[rapporteur]] quite rightly notes, these new agreements will not enter into force immediately as [[we]] firstly have to prepare, negotiate and conclude each one.	Amb,Amb
492	[[Madam President]], [[I]] believe [[we]] must take good note of the fact that a [[representative]] of Euskal Herritarrok has expressed his regret at the murder of an honourable local [[councillor]] in the Basque Country.	Female,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb

496	Usually, NGOs also provide their female [[patients]] with elementary hygiene education.	Female
497	Unfortunately, the work of the group of [[experts]] has been inconclusive and the preliminary report submitted to the Transport Council on 16 October merely stresses, firstly, that much remains to be done in order to ensure that safety measures are being applied effectively in all airports and, secondly, identifies the need for new measures to prevent the dangerous behaviour of some [[individuals]] in aircraft, such as banning access to cockpits or enhancing cooperation between civil monitoring of air traffic and the use of military air defence methods.	Amb,Amb
498	Mr [[President]], the [[Commission's]] proposals for fully liberalising the internal market in electricity and natural gas in the Member States of the European Union are, in our view, on the right track, which is why the rapporteurs, Mr [[Turmes]], Mr [[Rapkei]] and Mr [[Mombaur]], basically endorsed them.

499	From now on, [[we]] must speak of 'the rights of the [[individual]]', and whilst quickly leafing through Mr [[Corbett's]] report, [[I]] unfortunately noticed that, despite vigilant efforts on both sides, some mistakes have still slipped through the net.	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb

502	[[I]] should like to follow on from the question put by Mr [[Alavanos]] in connection with the 2001-2002 harvest, which is now a fait accompli.	Amb,Male

510	Thank you, Sir [[Robert]].	Male
511	(DE) Madam [[President-in-Office]] of the Council, do you think it is helpful if European Member States unilaterally carry out as many as 1 million naturalisations over a short period, thereby, of course, setting a precedent for the others?	Female

514	The concerns to which [[you]] have given voice were among the main reasons for the initiation of the EU troika's dialogue with the US State Department's legal [[advisor]].	Amb,Amb
515	As far as [[I]] know it has never happened before that [[someone]] has been pressured to withdraw his candidacy purely and simply because he was nominated by a [[group]] that rows against the mainstream.	Amb,Male,Amb
516	If she is to be taken seriously as a progressive [[leader]] of a more modern Pakistan, she must make sure that Pakistan respects its international obligations under human rights conventions.	Female

518	I say this as a keen [[fan]] and observer of the Athens Olympics.	Amb
519	[[I]] would like to congratulate the [[rapporteur]] and also the [[shadow rapporteurs]] and thank them for good cooperation.	Amb,Amb,Amb

521	An Iranian [[man]] has been hanged for rape, despite his alleged [[victim]] withdrawing her accusations and a judicial review being ordered into the sentence.	Male,Female

523	[[Member]] of the [[Commission]]. - My answer to the last question is no, this is a completely different thing.	Amb,Amb
524	This key [[figure]] must be the voice of Europe in the world.	Amb
525	It will also be the case that these changes will encourage [[employers]] to choose male [[candidates]] over [[women]].	Amb,Male,Female
526	The [[President]] said this was unacceptable and invited Mr [[Bloom]] to apologise.	Amb,Male
527	In fact, the real reason was later elucidated by the state-run Global Times newspaper in a menacing editorial, which said that Mr [[Ai]] would pay a price for his resistance.	Male
528	[[author]]. - Mr [[President]], this [[Parliament]] conducted an investigation into the so-called renditions programme and went to Poland and two other countries, including Romania, where there were allegations of secret prisons.	Amb,Male,Amb
529	As some of [[you]] may know, four days ago I was appointed to become the new Foreign [[Minister]] of Greece.	Amb,Amb
530	[[I]] would ask you, Madam [[President]], to ask the [[mayor]] of Strasbourg whether she might be able to arrange for [[us]] to receive a Dutch station here in Parliament, so that we can follow the news in the Netherlands.	Amb,Female,Female,Amb
531	Madam [[President]], in this week's European Voice , German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] is quoted as 'urging [[Germans]] to work harder, finish their education earlier and retire later' .	Female,Amb,Amb

Female,Female,Amb,Male,Female,Amb
654	Or if the [[Chancellor]] is too busy to go that far, at least on the Wittenbergplatz!	Amb
655	However, before [[we]] can talk about that, we have to think about assembling those [[troops]], as Mrs [[Gomes]] has said, and not only putting the force together but equipping it too.	Amb,Amb,Female
656	Two weeks ago, together with the [[President]] of the European Council, [[I]] was in China and India for the summits between the European Union and these two emerging powers.	Amb,Amb
657	I recall that when I was a [[student]], [[we]] simply used to host young [[people]] from Iraq in our secondary schools.	Amb,Amb,Amb
658	in writing. - (PT) [[I]] voted in favour of Mrs [[Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou's]] report on the particular situation of [[women]] in prison and the impact of the imprisonment of [[parents]] on social and [[family]] life, since there is evidence that European prisons are geared largely towards male [[prisoners]] and overlook women's specific needs.	Amb,Female,Female,Amb,Amb,Male
659	It is only thanks to the fact that the newer EU Member States have reduced their emissions considerably more quickly that the EU as a whole can claim world [[leader]] status in this sphere.	Amb
660	However, [[we]] are aware that certain [[people]] favour the alternative plan proposed by the [[Council]], which does not support the [[trustee]] concept and intends to propose a separate vote.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
661	The sex industry today uses the Internet and the sexual violence that many [[women]] and [[children]] suffer.	Female,Amb
662	Reconstruction should be an opportunity for huge innovation in sustainable development for those [[people]] who have shown [[us]] all that they not only have great dignity, but also great courage and an overwhelming desire to start afresh.	Amb,Amb

667	It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used, whether these [[institutions]] are meeting the objectives outlined for them, and whether any resources are being wasted.	Amb
668	The EU, as a non-state [[member]] acceding to a convention that was designed for states, should take care not to demand needless changes to the convention or to its judicial system.	Amb
669	(The [[speaker]] pretends to gag herself for a few seconds, to show that she cannot speak)	Female
670	As the [[President]] of the European Parliament, I represent all of [[you]].	Amb,Amb
671	Mr [[President]], does the [[speaker]] appreciate that the so-called EU funds which she referred to as having been received by her [[constituents]] are simply the UK's own money being returned, but being returned only in part and after the European Union has skimmed off its [[croupier's]] share?	Male,Female,Amb,Amb
672	Incidentally, [[I]] just noticed once again during the previous speech that [[we]] have an excellent [[chair]] of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, because what he said is very similar to what I wanted to say.	Amb,Amb,Male
673	In our country, the United Kingdom, there are more than 4 million [[people]] who are either unemployed or on incapacity benefit and yet every month [[we]] are bringing [[people]] in from all over the world to do jobs that are not being taken by [[people]] born in the United Kingdom.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
674	It is right to welcome, in particular, the [[Commission's]] hard work and that of Mrs [[Bonino]], as well as the Commission services and those of the Member States, which have been dealing with this sector throughout the negotiations.	Amb,Female
675	[[I]] assume that our Austrian [[colleague]] was so delighted at the results of his elections that he forgot to mention this today.	Amb,Male
676	[[We]] think the [[Commission's]] three proposals are broadly unacceptable unless they are changed and we naturally agree with the [[rapporteur]] that there should be a group of [[experts]] which includes trade [[unionists]], SMEs, [[scientists]], Parliament and the Commission, to give us a clear idea and a clear proposal for a directive guaranteeing [[worker]] consultation, information and participation once and for all.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
677	Madam [[President]], [[I]] come from the North and am not in the habit of passing on congratulations for reports unnecessarily.	Female,Amb
678	Continuing with the [[panel]] would probably have created a political atmosphere in which the US would probably have been more tempted actually to implement the D'Amato Act and reject suspension.	Amb
679	There is an interesting [[model]] in Sweden.	Amb
680	[[I]] am grateful to the [[Member]] both for her kind remarks and also for the clarification she has given to the context of that debate.	Amb,Female
681	It was a statement that was absolutely and plainly true but it is also a statement that no senior Bosnian [[politician]] would have made until the last few months.	Amb
682	[[I]] will finish by saying that [[we]] also need a change of culture, as was apparent yesterday when, debating this directive, a [[colleague]] rolled his eyes and said 'Oh dear, I haven't given my [[son]] his pocket money for four weeks.'	Amb,Amb,Male,Male
683	Mr [[President]], there can be no equivocation: ethnic cleansing and enormous injustice against the Albanian [[population]] are totally unacceptable.	Male,Amb
684	Madam [[Minister]], [[I]] apologise for not being able to stay for your reply as I have another urgent commitment, but I would like to send a few words of Finnish to your country: Minä rakastan sinua ( I love you).	Female,Amb
685	Sadly, Mr [[President]], even though Mrs [[De Palacio]] answered our questions on transport to our satisfaction, and as a [[group]] we will no doubt endorse the [[Commission]] tomorrow, we must enter a reservation on the candidature of Mrs De Palacio pending the findings of the OLAF and the Spanish [[authorities']] investigations and because of the way she responded to questioning on this issue at her hearing.	Male,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
686	But [[I]] have no doubt at all that we will be expected to be sizeable [[contributors]] to the reconstruction of East Timor, though I imagine the honourable [[Member]] would agree with me that [[others]] should be contributors as well and I imagine that the honourable Member would also think it sensible for us to try to draw on the lessons of reconstruction activities elsewhere, not least in Kosovo to ensure that the money we deploy in East Timor is spent as effectively and rapidly as possible.

903	Mr [[President]], let [[me]] first of all thank my honourable [[friend]] for his extremely thoughtful report and for the care and attention that he has devoted to the issue of uprooted [[people]] in Asia and Latin America.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb
904	Therefore, Madam [[President]], [[I]] understand that the intention of Mr [[Lannoye]] and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will become legitimate when you present the Conference of [[Presidents]]' proposal to this House, which may be in July, but at the moment I believe that Mr Lannoye' s proposal is not appropriate.	Female,Amb,Male,Amb
905	In the European Union [[we]] are currently running the risk of our debate being elitist and of the progress only reaching some of the more informed and more privileged [[women]], leaving behind the rest, who are young women, immigrant women, single [[mothers]], victims of the white slave trade, etc.	Amb,Female,Female
906	And [[we]] are talking about cosmetics, not medical products; we are talking about shampoos and anti-wrinkle creams, and as Mr [[Davies]] said earlier, there is certainly no shortage of those in the shops already.	Amb,Male
907	But [[I]] would point out to my British [[colleague]] that he agreed with the UK [[government]] that Article 234 of the Treaty did in fact render this conflict invalid.	Amb,Male,Amb
908	Madam [[Minister]], [[I]] myself am Catalan, a Catalan from Roussillon, in other words a French national, and I applied to be included in a coalition in the Spanish State, a Basque-Catalan coalition, and that is why I, the Catalan, have taken over from Mr [[Gorka Knörr]], the Basque.	Female,Amb,Male
909	However, [[I]] should like to add to what Mr [[Nisticò]] has said by pointing out that I am pleased with the oral amendment to Mr Nisticò' s Amendment No 75 and that, in my view, there is [[no one]] at all in this House who could dream of putting a [[patient]] in a situation in which he was unable to obtain blood or plasma.	Amb,Male,Amb,Male
910	Consequently [[I]] consider it premature to effectively ban any donation which is not fully in line with the definition of 'voluntary, non-remunerated donation' provided for in Amendment No 17 and to this extent I agree with Mr [[Nisticò]] and with the contributions from Mrs [[Ries]], Mrs [[Müller]], Mr [[Bowis]] and Mrs [[Doyle]].	Amb,Male,Female,Female,Male,Female
911	It is an infernal vicious circle, because unless there are sufficient resources for these basic health services, for improving the [[people' s]] quality of life, for them to have access to housing, food and work, it will be difficult to eradicate these diseases.	Amb
912	Behind this seemingly formal request is my firm determination that, from now on, [[we]] recognise female [[farmers]] for the important role they play.	Amb,Female
913	This late hour is not particularly worthy of such an important debate and, what is more, it might have been a sign of respect if the [[Member]] of this Parliament who introduced these compromise amendments, acting against all the positions of the [[committee]] which she chairs, had come tonight, at least to explain to [[us]], to attempt to convince us why we miserable half-dozen Members who are still in the Chamber should, together with our [[groups]] and the other [[Members]], accept a u-turn on the positions adopted at first reading.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
914	In the most simple terms, this is about bringing [[administration]] closer to the [[citizen]].	Amb,Amb
915	For [[whom]] actually?	Amb
916	[[We]] fully agree with the honourable [[Members]] of Parliament that this process will also need the support of the international [[community]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
917	That is why [[I]] recommend that [[we]] should take the approach to the gas supply directive suggested by the [[rapporteur]], and which, after all, we agreed on with an overwhelming consensus in [[committee]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
918	In order to combat social exclusion, priority must be given to vulnerable groups of [[girls]] and [[women]], [[immigrants]], the [[disabled]], the [[destitute]], unmarried [[mothers]], women [[farmers]] etc. Similarly, the [[Commission]] needs to collate additional statistics on structural differences in the IT sector, so that [[we]] can investigate the real participation of [[women]], their representation and trends in the job market.	Female,Female,Amb,Female,Female,Female,Female,Amb,Amb,Female
919	Needless to say, [[we]] are delighted that there are three female [[Commissioners]], but we expect all Commissioners to raise the flag – if [[I]] may put it that way – for equal opportunities for [[men]] and [[women]].	Amb,Female,Amb,Male,Female
920	Mr [[Posselt]] is absolutely right about the risk of this becoming too narrow or too Brussels-centric, and that has been part of the problem until now.	Male

922	Many [[women’s]] organisations are carrying out campaigns to increase awareness amongst the [[citizens]].	Female,Amb
923	Because I believe that the structure in the methodology – and, as well as a [[politician]], I am speaking as an academic – is based on an error: it is based on repeating the old clichés and on not properly analysing today’s sustainable development problems.	Amb
924	[[We]] also see it as very important that [[women]] should acquire a legal status independent of that of their [[husbands]], and it is on this point that [[I]] would like to address Commissioner [[Frattini]] personally, for I recently, in a written question, asked to be informed as to whether he shared my concern about the series of court rulings in various Member States that, in the way in which they accord state benefits, effectively endorse polygamy.

926	(FR) Mr [[President]], in line with the [[rapporteur]], [[I]] should like to table an oral amendment to this report that will enable us to add a citation, the text of which I shall read out to you: 'having regard to the letter sent to the [[President]] of the European Parliament on 1 March 2007 by the [[chairman]] of the working [[group]] laid down in Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC, with regard to the issues linked to data protection, particularly in the administration of the SWIFT system,'.

929	At any rate, [[I]] would like to ask all [[Members]] to address the [[Chair]] and the House and not to direct their comments at other fellow [[Members]], in order to prevent disorderly interjections and interruptions.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
930	Madam [[colleague]], what do [[we]] do now?	Female,Amb
931	In the European Union, [[we]] have gained valuable experience with [[student]] exchange programmes among the Member States, and this system should now be intensified in our relations with Latin America and the Caribbean as well.	Amb,Amb
932	Along with my colleague Mrs [[Carlotti]], [[I]] wrote a letter to President [[Barroso]] on 6 May, for which I have not yet received an acknowledgement, but I hope to receive a reply one day.	Female,Amb,Amb
933	[[I]] call it a storm precisely because it seems to have caught the ear, unfortunately, of many female [[Members]] of this House.	Amb,Female
934	[[Colleagues]] may be aware that this is a sensitive issue and in some languages and for some Member States this does give difficulties.	Amb
935	[[We]] ask our fellow [[Members]] to support this alternative resolution.	Amb,Amb
936	Thanks to [[student]] exchanges, such as Erasmus, our young [[people]] are not only furthering their knowledge in specific subject areas, but are also broadening their horizons.	Amb,Amb
937	Might [[I]] therefore suggest that [[we]] call to task Mr [[Almunia]], the ex-Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, for example, as he was quite critical towards some countries during his term of office and then the Greek issue came up.	Amb,Amb,Male
938	In September, [[she]] appointed 29 [[people]] to senior positions within the [[delegations]], including seven female [[heads]] of delegation, which is nothing short of a 50% increase in the number of [[women]] at this level.	Female,Amb,Amb,Female,Female
939	The asylum package has been stalled for too long, and the common asylum system does not exist, Mr [[Weber]].	Male
940	[[I]] wish to highlight the importance of the agenda, which includes reports on the 'rights of [[persons]] belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic [[minorities]]' and on the 'promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism', as well as extensive meetings on the rights of the [[child]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
941	[[I]] went to Lampedusa on Monday and saw 4 000 - 5 000 [[people]] on the ground, huddling together to sleep under the sun and the rain, doing their business where they ate and not being able to change the wet clothes - which [[some]] have said were [[designer]] labels, but are, in fact, fake designer labels - they had on during the crossing, in lamentable conditions.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
942	[[We]] form some of our constituent [[members]] into an alliance of parties but we oppose the single statute.	Amb,Amb
943	Indeed, if I were the [[teacher]] referred to in a speech by Mr [[Simpson]] I would have to take account of two factors when marking the work.	Amb,Male
944	Our [[colleague]] was, it seemed to [[me]], wrongly interrupted and so I gave her an extra twenty to thirty seconds.	Female,Amb

946	Perhaps [[we]] should run a test and make it available only over the worldwide web, to find out how many Honourable [[Members]] really are connected to it.	Amb,Amb
947	There must be other ways of supporting the [[Customs]] who work with great efficiency and integrity despite [[manpower]] reductions and an increased flow of goods.	Amb,Amb
948	[[I]] bear in mind the point Mr [[Liese]] made earlier that there is only hope but this time [[we]] should consider the aspirations of the thousands of [[Europeans]] who suffer from currently incurable diseases and illnesses and give them some hope by promoting this directive and bringing some order to the field of biotechnology.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
949	Madam [[President]], Mr [[Commissioner]], there have been both social and political problems in fulfilling the criteria for EMU among present Member States.	Female,Male

Male,Amb
951	[[I]] would also like to pick up the observation made by Mr [[Spencer]] about our role in the former Yugoslavia.	Amb,Male
952	The aim of this report was, among other things, to support the proposal put forward by the [[Jacques Delors]] 'Our Europe' foundation, which suggests that the appointment of the future [[President]] of the European Commission should be an issue in the next European elections.	Amb,Amb
953	[[I]] give the floor to Mrs [[Bjerregaard]] to answer Mr [[Trakatellis's]] question.	Amb,Female,Male

1048	The response has been positive, as the [[Commissioner]] knows from his [[contacts]] throughout Europe, including a recent visit to Cambridge.	Male,Amb
1049	[[I]] wish to state that I voted against Mrs [[Van Lancker' s]] report.	Amb,Female
1050	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] must begin by lamenting the fact that the Commissioner for Fisheries, Mr [[Fischler]], cannot be here today.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Male
1051	That is why [[I]] would like to call on the [[Commissioner]] to pay even greater attention to this region.	Amb,Amb
1052	There are a number of [[Commissioners]], including Mr [[Kinnock]] and Mr [[Byrne]], who [[we]] know in advance will reply to questions.	Male,Male,Male,Amb
1053	Mr [[President]], [[I]] really can only echo what my friend and colleague, Mr [[Miller]], has said.	Male,Amb,Male
1054	There is no European Union [[diplomat]] who does not speak openly of the way the Israeli [[government]] has contravened international rules. Human rights [[organisations]] such as the United Nations and Amnesty International and Israeli organisations such as Betrelem also condemn this.	Amb,Amb,Amb
1055	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], the proposals made by [[Alexander Lamfalussy]] on the type of legislative process needed in connection with the implementation of the financial services package are a step in the right direction because, for the first time, a clear distinction has been made here between the law, the directive, the regulation passed by the [[Council]] and [[Parliament]] and the technical implementation of the directive.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
1056	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], the members of the liberal professions - tax [[accountants]], [[lawyers]] and [[notaries]] - are aware of the risk which money laundering poses to the social, financial and economic stability of a country and condemn any professional [[colleague]] who wittingly takes part in his [[client' s]] criminal activities.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
1057	In future, the statutory pension will no longer maintain a [[person's]] existing living standards in old age, but will merely offer basic provision.	Amb
1058	Madam [[President]], [[Prime Minister]], honourable [[Members]] of the European Parliament, [[I]] naturally want to begin by thanking you for giving me the opportunity to come here and present the [[Commission' s]] assessment of the European Council meeting in Göteborg.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
1059	[[You]] and the [[President]] of the Commission have spoken rightly about the Middle East.	Amb,Amb
1060	B5-0082/2002 by Mrs [[Sauquillo Pérez del Arco]] and Mr [[Van den Berg]] on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists,	Female,Male
1061	[[I]] know that there is a match, Mr [[Ebner]], but we must press on.	Amb,Male
1062	[[Immigrants]] and [[asylum seekers]] easily serve as scapegoats for societies that have become the victims of economic liberalism and capitalist globalisation.	Amb,Amb
1063	[[I]] do not know how my former [[colleague]] had thought the [[Council]] could remove this threat.	Amb,Amb,Amb
1064	Their joyfulness is tempered only by the continuation of the bitter legacy of [[Saddam]].	Amb
1065	Once again [[I]] appeal to the [[Commission]] to examine how [[we]] can take social responsibility for those major [[animal]] diseases, such as [[fowl]] pest, such as [[swine]] fever, and in this case foot and mouth, in order to arrive at a coherent policy.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
1066	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would thank my colleague Mr [[Lisi]] for the report he has presented on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds in paints, varnishes and vehicle refinishing products.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Male
1067	Finally, [[I]] very much support the amendments by Mrs [[Junker]] and Mr [[Bowis]] on the problem of vaginal fistula.	Amb,Female,Male
1068	Then it is good to refer to another point, the point about the constitutional state, and in this context Mr [[Schulz]] has referred to Guantanamo Bay.	Male
1069	[[We]] will see how successful [[you]] are, along with our [[colleague]] who spoke Catalan yesterday, or my German [[colleagues]] who speak Sorbian.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
1070	[[Madam President]], [[I]] should like to join the previous [[speaker]] in thanking the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr [[Schmit]], for having placed our concerns regarding a new debt relief initiative in a broader context from the very start.	Female,Amb,Amb,Male
1071	Furthermore, [[I]] received an e-mail today from Mrs [[Záborská]], which she sent to all [[Members]] about a resolution by the General Assembly of the United Nations – resolution 59516 – on this specific subject, but which Mrs Záborská did not mention in her speech.	Amb,Female,Amb
1072	[[He]] is, of course, a [[victim]], but there is another casualty and that is the state of human rights and civil liberties within the EU.	Male,Male
1073	In this way, [[we]] have managed to considerably improve, sometimes at the expense of jeopardising the viability of the sector, the protection of laying [[hens]], [[calves]] and breeding [[sows]].	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
1074	I say that as a [[Member]] of the Commission and as a father and politician, not just because I am replacing my colleague Mr [[Dimas]].	Male,Male
1075	[[I]] should like wholeheartedly to congratulate the [[rapporteur]] and the [[coordinators]] on the quality of the work done, but I deplore the insufficient efforts made to encourage greater plurality and regret that the assessments of standardisation activities should be so infrequent.	Amb,Amb,Amb
1076	[[I]] support what Mrs [[Hieronymi]] just said: that [[we]] did not want to raise these problems.	Amb,Female,Amb
1077	[[I]] hope the [[Commission]] will take that message to her [[colleague]]. I hope it will make him better.	Amb,Amb,Male
1078	If Turkey fully complies with these criteria, then obviously it can become a [[member]] of the European Union.	Amb
1079	[[author]]. - (PL) Mr [[President]], once again [[we]] are talking about Iran.	Amb,Male,Amb
1080	(EL) Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to mention a brutal attack on an ethnic Greek [[journalist]], which took place on 5 December in Istanbul.	Male,Amb,Amb
1081	On the basis of her citizenship, the above-mentioned [[citizen]] was guaranteed consular protection by the country in which she is a citizen.	Female
1082	Clearly, policies depend on [[people]], and there could be room for such a venture within your area of competence, [[Madam]].	Amb,Female
1083	(BG) Thank you, Mme [[Chair]].	Female
1084	Given that [[we]] are in France, [[I]] think it was a French [[writer]] who said that anything that is excessive lacks value.	Amb,Amb,Amb
1085	(DE) Madam [[President]], to keep everything up to date, [[I]] would ask that the following text be incorporated, which you will find on your voting list:	Female,Amb
1086	[[I]] would like to congratulate my [[colleague]] on her work; she has presented an excellent report.	Amb,Female
1087	However, on issues such as the ones contained in this report, [[I]] like to speak to [[Members]] like Mr [[Allister]], who, whilst not from my political party, is a hard-working and pragmatic Member in this place; his counsel is often wise and he is someone with whom I know I can agree to disagree in a civilised way - as I do on what he just said.	Amb,Male,Male
1088	A poorly drafted protection regulation may, in some circumstances, go against employing young [[women]] since the cost of employing them would become more expensive than employing their male [[colleagues]].	Female,Male
1089	Mr [[President]], the reason for this urgency is the brutal murder of 57 [[people]], who were accompanying a [[politician]] on her way to register as a candidate in the elections for the position of provincial governor.	Male,Amb,Female
1090	A group of [[women]] has started a grass-roots initiative to draft a law on parity in politics, so that 50% of the [[candidates]] in elections would have to be women.	Female,Female
1091	The particular sensitivity of this subject justifies the assigning of the report to one of the [[Members]] of this House who has dedicated himself most to this subject, my colleague, Mr [[Coelho]];	Male,Male
1092	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], first of all [[I]] should like to congratulate Mr [[Lyon]] on his work, and also the [[Chair]] and the [[Secretariat]] of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
1093	But that should not stop [[us]], as a European Union, from engaging with Egypt and the Arab world to support democracy and human rights, and [[I]] expect my [[colleague]], despite her different views on Europe, to share this view with me.	Amb,Amb,Female
1094	[[I]] voted in favour of the report by Mr [[Audy]] because the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) needs to be thoroughly revised in order for it to achieve and come into line with the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy.	Amb,Male
1095	The SLORC regime, despite representations from the [[ambassadors]] of Member States present in Rangoon, refused [[me]] permission to visit [[her]] despite the fact that I was carrying a letter from the [[President]] of the European Parliament informing her officially of the award of the Sakharov Prize.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
1096	Madam [[President]], our [[group]] believes that the European Union should head any international intervention aimed at preventing the humanitarian disaster in eastern Zaire which we have been witnessing, at once horrified and powerless, for several weeks now.	Female,Amb
1097	The consensus this morning amongst most [[groups]] shows that the [[Commissioner]] is quite right to take further the regulatory [[body]] that she has in mind and she has seen that there is a wish to have that strengthened.	Amb,Female,Amb
1098	The Security [[Council]] however decided to await the report of the [[advisor]] from the United Nations humanitarian affairs department who was sent to Sudan before the resolution was presented for implementation; his mission was to investigate the consequences of such a sanction on Sudan Airways, particularly its effect on humanitarian aid.	Amb,Male
1099	Subsidies are too bureaucratic: there won't be a penny for the risk-bearing [[entrepreneur]].	Amb
1100	Of course the attempt to apply the Maastricht method to employment policy, with the very sensible proposals made by Mr [[Juncker]] as well as by the [[Commission]], is by no means just a continuation of previous policy.	Male,Amb
1101	If [[we]] do a simple division exercise, however, we see that this works out at only ECU 8 for each unemployed [[person]] in Europe.	Amb,Amb
1102	Basically, Mr [[de Silguy]] is a little bit like the [[Africans]]: he confuses the symbol and the symbolized.	Male,Amb
1103	Mr [[President]], [[we]] would not be able to have this debate if Commissioner [[Papoutsis]] had not presented us with his White Paper and we thank him very much for it.	Male,Amb,Male
1104	Mr [[Miller]] described graphically what happens at Brussels airport.	Male
1105	The development of human potential needs to be highlighted in the context of innovation, with incentives provided for training, mobility and [[researcher]] and [[scientist]] exchanges, in particular for SMEs, and contacts between the academic, scientific and industrial [[communities]] need to be strengthened.	Amb,Amb,Amb
1106	[[Women]] will be treated only by female [[doctors]] and [[men]] only by male [[doctors]].	Female,Female,Male,Male
1107	Therefore, the arguments, particularly those advanced by the Socialist Group [[Leader]], are inappropriate.	Amb
1108	Nonetheless, in reality [[you]] are rigorously ensuring that the opposite of this occurs. If the reduction in agricultural prices is not fully compensated the outcome is a fall in agricultural incomes, which forces the [[farmer]] to look for other forms of compensation to keep his head above water.	Amb,Male
1109	[[We]] will follow in our budgetary presentation the wish of the [[rapporteur]].	Amb,Amb
1110	[[I]] continued with her efforts and have tried to work on this essential action which the [[Commission]] must take - the defence of [[women]], young [[people]] and [[children]] - in order to prevent the violence which, unfortunately, is regularly directed at them.	Female,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
1111	Several of the [[speakers]], among them Mr [[Souchet]], have touched on this point.	Amb,Male
1112	As Mrs [[Theorin]] pointed out, [[we]] are not able at this stage to select four or five areas, given that we are required by the Beijing platform to give equal priority to the twelve areas but we could, of course, focus our attention on the fifth action programme when we discuss the selection of priorities at European level.

1326	[[I]] believe that the position adopted by Mr [[Cox]] - who formed a strategic majority with [[you]] in order to have Mrs [[Fontaine]] elected - is a compromise that makes it possible for [[everyone]] here to vote for a report on racism with their head held high.	Amb,Male,Amb,Female,Amb
1327	Mr [[President]], the European Central Bank report under discussion covers 1999, its first year in operation following the start of the third stage of EMU and, for this very reason, the European [[Parliament]]'[[s]] criticism of the European Central Bank's annual report should be even stricter and even more demanding.

1330	[[We]] can probably allow the [[Commissioner]] to take the floor in order to present his points of view, in spite of the fact that we have already made a decision.	Amb,Male
1331	Madam [[President]], [[I]] shall try to be brief, but I should like to say to the rapporteur, Mr [[Olsson]], that this report comes at a time when [[we]] have the impression that we have reached a standstill in the BSE crisis.	Female,Amb,Male,Amb
1332	This is, of course, very important to the EBRD, as it is focused on priority objectives such as financing SMEs, financing medium-sized [[enterprises]], industrial restructuring and regional development.	Amb
1333	The search for a solution to the present difficulty has led the [[Commission]] to concentrate on the second way referred to in Mr [[Wynn's]] and Mr [[Brok's]] joint resolution.	Amb,Male,Male
1334	Since the [[candidate]] - as Mr [[Goebbels]] has indirectly pointed out - also meets the main requirements laid down in the Treaty, namely recognised standing and professional experience in monetary and banking matters, [[I]] believe that [[we]] can support her appointment with a clear conscience.	Female,Male,Amb,Amb
1335	[[I]] am, however, somewhat concerned about what [[we]] voted on in paragraph 10, in which we call on the European Union to provide financial support for the operation of the European Women and Sport network, as I was under the impression that this was a private organisation of which a [[nephew]] of Mrs [[Fraisse]] is the chairman or at least plays a major role.	Amb,Amb,Male,Female
1336	To conclude, and to reassure Mrs [[Schörling]], the judgment confirms that, both under current law and under the joint text, production methods are legitimate award criteria and may be given quite a high weight provided always that the criterion is formulated and applied in such a way as to meet the four requirements set out explicitly in both the Helsinki case and in recital 1 of the joint text.	Female
1337	One of [[them]] has now been relieved of that position by the sovereign [[population]] of my country and he will therefore no longer be Head of Government when any insult is directed at him.	Male,Amb
1338	As regards relations with the United States, a question raised by various honourable [[Members]], including Mr [[Swoboda]], Mrs [[Mussolini]], Mr [[Schultz]] and Mr [[Evans]], [[I]] believe that it is important that the European Union should not define itself in terms of its opposition to any given country or region.	Amb,Male,Female,Male,Male,Amb
1339	Mrs [[Jensen]], the [[rapporteur]] on the flexibility instrument; Mr [[Böge]], and other [[members]] of the Committee on Budgets who participated very closely in all-day and all-night negotiations deserve thanks from all of [[us]] for the hard-won results.	Female,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
1340	Mr [[President]], if you perhaps try to explain what this is all about to a young female [[citizen]] of the European Union and to a middle-aged male [[one]], do you not inevitably end up making comparisons with the Soviet Union and telling them that [[we]] are dealing with a seven-year plan rather than a five-year one?	Male,Female,Male,Amb
1341	In the meantime however, [[you]], together with your [[colleague]], may remain in your current seats, and this will not even affect the use of the voting cards.	Amb,Amb
1342	[[I]] say this because I have before me the report by the special [[representative]] – as [[you]] referred to him – of the European Union for human rights for Georgia dated 12 April, which describes the human rights situation, and I must say it describes a very unpleasant situation for [[Greeks]] in Georgia.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
1343	There is no comparison between the health and safety concerns as a result of exposure to sunlight, for instance, between a Nigerian [[worker]] on an Irish building site and an Irish [[worker]] on a Greek building site.	Amb,Amb
1344	[[I]] also remember the scepticism surrounding the creation of the African Union three years ago.	Amb
1345	Finally, Mrs [[Járóka]] has proven to [[us]] all how important the contribution of Romani [[women]] can be.	Female,Amb,Female
1346	Secondly, [[I]] wish it to be recorded in the Minutes that I have spoken on behalf of Mrs [[Miguélez Ramos]], just as Mr [[Vatanen]] has spoken on behalf of Mr [[Daul]].	Amb,Female,Male,Male
1347	This is not just about the death of the [[journalist]], horrific as that is; it is not just about Chechnya; it is also about Russian treatment of Georgia in the recent past and what [[they]] have done.	Amb,Amb
1348	It is true that two other Member States have voted against it, but, at the same time - as the German [[Chancellor]] said in her speech on the German Presidency here a few weeks ago - many [[people]] who reject this Constitutional Treaty also want the European Union to have more powers and responsibilities, for example in the field of energy.	Female,Amb
1349	on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Madam [[President]], [[Mr President-in-Office]], [[Commissioners]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], this is the first time [[we]] have held the annual debate in which we prepare for the spring summit in the afternoon.	Female,Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb
1350	Because by "health and reproductive rights” the [[author]] and [[promoters]] of this report mean the opposite of what those words actually say.	Amb,Amb
1351	[[I]] cannot tell [[you]] more now, but [[we]] have tools like Europe Diary, which precisely targets [[teenagers]], and we have Dolcetta, which is a complement to [[teacher]] education, but we are very much reliant on the efforts of the Member States.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
1352	Finally, Madam [[Minister]], when you take the floor again, perhaps you can tell [[us]] whether France, for example, has linked its efforts to those that it has been making under the environmental Grenelle?	Female,Amb
1353	[[I]] believe that Mrs [[Gutiérrez]], whose work I would describe as remarkable, has presented [[us]] with very acceptable proposals in an effort to bring the different sides closer together - because indeed we see that there really is quite marked opposition within [[Parliament]], just as there is within the [[Council]] - and that by listening to Parliament she has finally succeeded in putting forward proposals that appear to be as consensual as possible.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
1354	[[Member]] of the [[Commission]]. - Madam [[President]], it is understandable in this climate that there is concern about the success of manufacturing in the face of competition, and of course textiles are very important.	Amb,Amb,Female
1355	Finally, as my time is up, my last sentence is that [[I]] recommended that local non-governmental [[organisations]] become involved in EU campaigns, for these are much better acquainted with local [[communities]], and know the language in which they can reach their [[populations]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
1356	[[I]] also notice the opposed initiative from Mrs [[Lulling]] and Mr [[Karas]] supporting, through Amendment 28, the option for these three Member States to pursue the levying of the withholding tax and to abstain from automatic information exchange on a permanent basis.	Amb,Female,Male
1357	As one of our fellow [[Members]] has made an accusation, [[I]] will ask him to clarify his accusation. As [[you]] said, the verification needs to take place immediately, and if, as I believe, it turns out after verification that the accusation is false, I ask that all the conclusions be drawn from this.	Male,Amb,Amb
1358	[[I]] am not just saying this on account of Mrs [[Malmström]] and Mrs [[Wallström]], who are sitting here.	Amb,Female,Female
1359	It is perfectly natural that when [[we]] look at different [[commissioners]], we see that each tries to make a priority of the issue that is his most pressing concern.	Amb,Male
1360	In Austria, everything is turned on its head, because the better qualified [[women]] are, the worse their advancement is compared to their male [[colleagues]] with the same qualifications. Very recent figures show that women's disadvantage increases with age, for example, women over 60 earn around 34% less than their male colleagues.	Female,Male
1361	But, yes ... as you know, Mr [[Verhofstadt]], ours is the only [[group]] to have been critical, even when there was a [[Green]] in the [[Commission]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
1362	This directive is a very important step towards combating the scale of this terrible crime, laying down more severe penalties and sanctions, and further enhancing prevention and [[victim]] protection.	Amb
1363	[[I]] believe that the European [[Commission]] should, first and foremost: 1) inform [[Parliament]] what measures have been or will be taken at European level in order to prevent international adoption becoming a front for [[child]] trafficking; 2) provide an answer to the question of how the Commission intends to prevent [[children]] being adopted to fit in with the latest fashion.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
1364	[[We]] must not destroy what has been achieved on the basis of a consensus between [[unions]] and [[management]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
1365	[[I]] would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms [[Mathieu]], and wish her and the Hungarian Presidency my best.	Amb,Female

1603	- [[I]] wholeheartedly support [[Ewa Klamt' s]] report on the fight against [[child]] exploitation.	Amb,Amb,Amb
1604	[[I]] can even answer the honourable [[Member]] by saying that a group of [[experts]] is already working on identifying the best actions for combating the networks of [[traffickers]] in [[human beings]] and that I myself had an opportunity recently, on a mission to Greece, to exchange ideas with the Greek [[Minister]] for Home Affairs, in order enlist the cooperation of his [[government]] in establishing these actions and priorities, bearing in mind the action that Greece is already developing bilaterally on the trafficking of human [[beings]] in the Balkans.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
1605	With regard to high-risk pregnancies and the birth of disabled [[children]], it is obvious that provision must be made for specially adapted proposals offering an extension of the length of maternity leave, taking account of the specifics of the case.	Amb
1606	Quite recently, at the UN 'Women 2000' conference, our Polish [[friends]] were able to see just how flexible common diplomacy really is when they were ordered to fall into line with the position laid down by the Union, or face delays in their country' s application for Membership.	Female
1607	Mr [[Deva]] has given the views of my [[group]], which [[I]] totally support, and it is significant this afternoon that there is not one single [[person]] who has spoken who is not at one with these ideas and with the general support for [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] and her [[party]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
1608	Your [[colleague]] in the brown jacket nodded to say 'alright' , but [[I]] was not called to submit my question.	Amb,Amb
1609	In December 1998, a British [[judge]] decided the case of a Dutch [[student]] who had broken his neck in an accident and since been paralysed from neck to toe.	Amb,Male
1610	[[I]] would like you, Mr [[Fatuzzo]]," he added, "to ensure that [[we]] receive our pensions quickly and on time".	Male,Male,Amb
1611	Mr [[President]], as has been mentioned, on the 5th this [[Parliament]] approved the [[Watson]] report, with a series of measures which were essential to dealing with the issue of terrorism.	Male,Amb,Amb
1612	[[I]] should like to put my second question to both the [[Minister]] and the [[Commissioner]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
1613	Mr [[President]], [[I]] salute the [[rapporteur]] for his efforts.	Male,Amb,Male
1614	Mrs [[Lulling]] represents my older female [[colleagues]] here, whereas [[I]] am the youngest female member of the PPE-DE Group.	Female,Female,Female
1615	One such indirect system is the European Convention, only 17% of whose [[members]] are [[women]], and an example of a hierarchical system is the administration of the European Parliament, which is also short on equality.	Female,Female
1616	(The [[President]] cut off the [[speaker]])	Amb,Amb
1617	Mr [[Korakas]] has the floor for a point of order.	Male
1618	In relation to this, Mrs [[Weiler]], you mentioned the need to make a financial request or to examine the possibility of applying structural funds for this purpose – my [[experts]] here tell [[me]] that no such application has as yet been made to the [[Commission]].	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
1619	Any widening of the scope of this proposal is likely to jeopardise that objective, which [[I]] know is shared by Mrs [[Rühle]].	Amb,Female
1620	It is also the policies and priorities which can best address the aspirations of your [[citizens]].	Amb
1621	[[I]] therefore believe [[Commissioners]] must be guided by the basic principles of the European Union. The principle of solidarity is the most important of these.	Amb,Amb
1622	What [[athlete]] would knowingly cause damage to his heart or liver, his kidneys or reproductive organs?	Male
1623	Finally, [[I]] should like once again to thank the [[rapporteur]] for her efforts.	Amb,Female
1624	In this connection, [[I]] think [[we]] must look at the arguments put forward by Mrs [[Scheele]], who explains quite specifically that we are not reducing this suffering at all.	Amb,Amb,Female
1625	Another success was the arrest of a corrupt [[judge]], wanted by her country, Greece.	Female
1626	The Belgian [[minister]] for justice has also set in motion investigations into this matter, and her [[department]] is, in the initial stages at any rate, the right one to be investigating this sort of thing, for, according to current law, it is the Belgian legal system that must take action and make inquiries.	Female,Amb
1627	[[I]] hope that the [[Council's]] response to the vote in this House will be to embark on a more in-depth discussion of the matters at issue.	Amb,Amb
1628	[[I]] support the ideas put forward by Ms [[Járóka]], for example that all [[committees]] should have female [[members]].	Amb,Female,Amb,Female
1629	[[I]] am therefore very grateful to the German Presidency, the [[Health Minister]] and the [[Chancellor]] herself for refocusing on this disease and the simple ways in which [[we]] can protect ourselves.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
1630	Neither [[I]] nor Mr [[Schwab]], who is a Christian Democrat like me, believe that the viability of the social protection system can be called into question.	Amb,Male
1631	Both his reports are of a lamentable standard, and cast [[him]] into ridicule as a [[lawyer]].	Male,Male
1632	on behalf of the GUE/NGL [[Group]]. - (FR) Madam [[President]], Mr [[President-in-Office of the Council]], [[Commissioner]], during our next sitting [[we]] will again approve the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
1633	[[They]] should also be given the opportunity to return from maternity leave to the labour market, but also to further studies.	Female
1634	But there are plenty of elderly [[women]] in my constituency who would love to have the same benefits of health-care provision that are provided to women [[inmates]] in prisons throughout the UK.	Female,Female
1635	[[President-in-Office]]. - (SL) Madam [[President]], thank you very much.	Amb,Female
1636	Such proposals help to undermine the unjustified respect that many [[citizens]] of EU Member States feel for the EU's efforts - efforts to transfer power from democratic Member States to a bureaucratic Brussels.	Amb
1637	It is particularly heartening that 35% of the [[Members]] are women - a percentage that has never been as high before in the European Parliament.	Female
1638	(FR) Mr [[President]], [[Minister]], on 11 November, [[Václav Havel]] said to [[us]], 'Europe is the homeland of our homelands'.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
1639	[[I]] would also have liked it to be extended, and indeed hope it can be in the future, beyond the trans-European network infrastructure and, above all, to farming vehicles, given that quite often [[we]] find, particularly in regions like the one where I come from, that there is an accident and the [[person]] dies because it has not been possible to get there in time, or because his emergency call was not received.	Amb,Amb,Male
1640	(IT) [[Madam President]], [[Commissioner]], [[I]] believe that [[Parliament]] has a great opportunity today to reiterate that motherhood is a social value, that the protection of a [[mother's]] health and that of her [[child]] must be strengthened, that a female [[worker]] must not be discriminated against for being a mother in finding and keeping a job, and that childcare should be better shared with [[fathers]].	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Amb,Female,Male
1641	[[We]] understand, [[Minister]], the positions of [[governments]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
1642	Madam [[President]], honourable [[Members]], this new directive shows the Union's determination to give Europe's [[enterprises]], and especially SMEs, a decisive boost to get through the economic crisis, which the [[Commission]] intends to tackle by means of a series of actions.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
1643	Next week, Commissioner [[Cioloş]] will present his proposal to reform the common agricultural policy; he will have to give some clear answers to [[farmers]].	Male,Amb
1644	As [[Chair]] of the [[Committee]] on Petitions, I have often run up against legal conflicts between Member States which result in negative or even tragic consequences for the [[children]] alone.	Amb,Amb,Amb
1645	Suffice it to say that, although the level of female education has increased significantly in recent years and the number of female [[graduates]] is now higher than that of male [[graduates]], women remain concentrated in traditionally female sectors and are frequently paid less and occupy fewer positions of responsibility in all spheres of society.	Female,Male
1646	[[I]] voted for the report by Mr [[Belder]] because, despite the numerous problems related to Iran's domestic and foreign policy such as, for example, the possible use of nuclear weapons, the lack of transparency in certain [[government]] decisions, and, in some cases, the failure to respect fundamental human rights, I believe that a policy based exclusively on sanctions cannot bring great benefits.	Amb,Male,Amb
1647	This programme specifically offers opportunities that [[we]] shall not be neglecting because the European economy needs greater substance and we need to be closer to [[businessmen]].	Amb,Male
1648	A country can freely decide - in the way described by our Swedish [[colleague]] - to run a public service as a public monopoly undertaking, and spend a great deal of money on it.	Amb
1649	[[They]] are not alibi-[[women]] - thank God - and want to be accepted and selected on the basis of their ability.	Female,Female
1650	First of all, [[we]] have Mr [[Hogg]] who has boycotted the [[Committee]] of Inquiry set up by this Parliament.	Amb,Male,Amb
1651	[[We]] do not want a common foreign policy with majority decisions, a common foreign [[ministry]] and a common foreign [[minister]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
1652	Secondly, as Mr [[Bösch]] said - and my [[group]] agrees with him - rapid utilization does not necessarily lead to effective utilization of the credits.	Male,Amb
1653	That also applies to the international [[community]].	Amb
1654	Madam [[President]], [[I]] would firstly like to thank our [[colleague]] for her excellent report which reasserts the fact that biotechnology should come under a specific and individual programme within the [[Commission's]] 5th Framework Programme.	Female,Amb,Female,Amb
1655	[[I]] think, Madam [[President]], that if [[we]] were to ask ourselves [[who]] benefits and [[who]] is harmed by this assassination, there can be no doubt that it was a hard blow for all those [[people]] who have shown determination and commitment to the Guatemalan peace process, which was so difficult to achieve.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
1656	But was this not retracted, Mr [[Liese]]?	Male
1657	Under our Rules of Procedure [[we]] will invite the successful [[candidate]] to speak to the [[Committee]] on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy on 21 June so that we may put a recommendation of approval to the July plenary.	Amb,Amb,Amb
1658	[[He]] was hardly acceptable as [[Minister]] for Industry and Commerce.	Male,Male
1659	In terms of political support, the European Union intends to continue and to encourage the efforts already undertaken by our special [[representative]] for the Great Lakes to facilitate the necessary degree of dialogue between the different [[factions]] involved in the DRC conflict.	Amb,Amb

1761	[[I]] can tell Mrs [[Pack]] that the precise opposite is the case: the fact is that [[we]] will be extending the Tempus Plus programme to all types of schooling, that is to say, to schools, vocational training, [[adult]] education and universities.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
1762	[[I]] believe [[we]] should welcome the step forward taken by the Irish Presidency and I believe that the announcement of the candidate to the Presidency of the Spanish Government, Mr [[Zapatero]], has been a significant step forward in terms of unblocking this situation.	Amb,Amb,Male

1765	We have much to do on this, [[colleagues]], so I would, in closing – as I believe the last MEP [[speaker]] of 2005 – wish you all a restful holiday, a happy Hogmanay as [[we]] call New Year in Scotland, and I look forward to seeing you in 2006 when we will be able to redouble our efforts on this dreadful situation.	Amb,Amb,Amb
1766	May [[I]], then, anticipate this by asking the [[Commissioner]], who is of course a keen swimmer, to make sure that his services carry out this assessment accordingly and perhaps after all raise the health standards to OECD levels, on which all States have in fact agreed, so that [[we]] do not find ourselves attempting to level down the health standards in this field.	Amb,Male,Amb
1767	[[I]] fully support the [[rapporteur’s]] point that there should be national support schemes.	Amb,Amb
1768	Incidentally, a Green Paper on the development of employment legislation in Europe will be published shortly, and will become, [[I]] hope, the basis for some very far-reaching discussions on the customs, methods and development of employment law and [[employer]]-[[employee]] legal relationships in the EU Member States.

1775	The [[Committee]] on Petitions is in favour of speeding up procedures to ensure that the [[Ombudsman's]] annual report is considered more quickly, and it is also in favour of amending the Statute, provided that the amendments simply involve a qualitative expansion of the Ombudsman's powers, without affecting the nature of his competences or the non-binding effect of all his decisions.

1783	Can [[I]] also ask the [[Commissioner]] that if she cannot speak today, she would maybe let [[us]] have a statement in writing, because I do not believe this House is divided for one moment.	Amb,Female,Amb
1784	[[I]] am also full of admiration for the Hungarian [[ambassador]], who really did all she could, as did Mr [[Dalli]], in fact.	Amb,Female,Male
1785	In industrialised countries, domestic work accounts for between 5 and 9% of all employment, with the vast majority of the [[people]] employed in that sector being [[women]].	Female,Female
1786	In addition, [[Alexander Lukashenko]] is losing control, not only over the situation in the country, but also over his own behaviour, which can be seen in the astonishing, shocking and offensive statements made in reference to the [[President]] of Ukraine and Mr [[Barroso]].	Male,Amb,Male

1789	When we met six months ago the European Parliament's tone was far more negative in terms of the expectations. [[I]] listened to you with humility as becomes an interim [[director]], but nonetheless it was a relatively negative image that I was presented with.	Amb,Amb
1790	Madam [[President]], Mr [[Commissioner]], my colleague Mr [[Bontempi]] (who has asked [[me]] to apologize for his absence as he has been held up in Spain today, for reasons indirectly connected with mountain regions) and I have, like other [[Members]], noted the absence of any general debate in this house on mountain region policy, during the last ten years.

1886	Then it is seen that the [[author]] has been so keen on preventing the [[reader]] from guessing the solution that she has rather overstepped the bounds of what should be permitted to a [[writer]] of detective stories.	Female,Amb,Amb

1899	First of all [[I]] would like to support very much what my colleague Mr [[Piétrasanta]] said and say that our [[group]] will be voting for the reports by Mr Piétrasanta and Mr [[Varela Suanzes-Carpegna]].	Amb,Male,Amb,Male
1900	This means that, with the rules being identical in every country, the common form must be respected to certify the need for medical treatment allowing a [[citizen]] to carry the substances mentioned in your question.	Amb
1901	Why ensure complex coordination between different countries to centralise an investigation if the [[judge]] in charge of the case does not have the resources to complete his investigation or secure conviction of the [[people]] charged?	Male,Amb
1902	Under extremely heavy international pressure and through intensive shuttle diplomacy by Mr [[Moratinos]], his security [[advisor]] and the team of European [[monitors]], combined with direct telephone contacts between Mr [[Peres]] and Mr [[Arafat]], a local cease-fire was arranged, prompting the Israeli [[Army]] to withdraw from Beit Jalla at the break of day on 29 August.	Male,Amb,Amb,Male,Male,Amb
1903	But it means much to [[me]] that Mr [[Klaus]], in the many, many conversations we have had, has always made it clear that he, himself, and his political [[friends]] desire and support the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union.	Amb,Male,Amb

1908	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would first of all like to reply to Mr [[Miller]], because I believe he has the wrong information.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Male
1909	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] must say that I am absolutely amazed by what I have just heard Mr [[Pirker]] say, and I will explain why.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Male
1910	In my heart, [[I]] am with Mrs [[Flemming]], and I endorse her arguments.	Amb,Female
1911	[[I]] appeal to [[Members]] of the House, particularly to such distinguished Members as Mr [[Blokland]] and Mr [[Ó Neachtain]], to think twice before holding this piece of legislation to ransom and perhaps even taking the step of voting against this report and legislation because the [[Commission]] cannot move at a speed that [[people]] believe is more appropriate.	Amb,Male,Male,Male,Amb,Amb
1912	[[I]] would also like to welcome the speech by the [[President]] of the Commission and to reaffirm, on behalf of my [[group]], that we, who are working for the Convention, and who are participating actively, believe that it should produce a draft Constitution, and not just a list of options.	Amb,Amb,Amb
1913	My final point is in response to Mrs [[Frahm]].	Female
1914	Mr [[Pronk]], [[I]] have answered your question.	Male,Amb
1915	[[I]] would like to take the opportunity, [[Commissioner]], to respond to the problem of the policy of providing information to European Union [[citizens]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
1916	In turn, gender-based violence is legitimised and [[women's]] human rights are denied.	Female
1917	[[Parliament's]] position is therefore maintained and self-handling has been restricted to on-board [[personnel]]. And, furthermore, with the social guarantees [[I]] referred to earlier.	Amb,Amb,Amb
1918	As regards the 1986 Directive on equal treatment of self-employed [[workers]], for example, including those working in agriculture, [[I]] draw your attention to our demands for a Directive on the status of [[spouses]], which is so important to the millions of invisible workers, mostly self-employed [[women]] working in agriculture.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
1919	Mr [[President]], as the first male [[speaker]] in this debate, I too wish to start by paying tribute to [[women]] on International Women’s Day, and refer in particular to those women to whom I have been closest; my [[grandmothers]], my [[mother]], my [[wife]] and my [[daughters]].	Male,Male,Female,Female,Female,Female,Female
1920	Mr [[President]], this is an important report on an important subject and [[I]] congratulate the [[rapporteur]] on her usual thoroughness and commitment.	Male,Amb,Female
1921	[[Who]] cares that 57% of all [[children]] who do not receive any basic schooling are [[girls]]?	Amb,Female,Female
1922	Tight restrictions on freedom of expression and on [[workers’]] rights, as well as on the right to form trade [[unions]] and to go on strike are also still giving cause for serious concern.	Amb,Amb
1923	Mr [[President]], [[Minister]], your reply is very disappointing because [[we]] are trying, or we have tried, to sell all the European [[citizens]] the idea that, on the basis of the Treaty establishing a Constitution, everything relating to common security is going to require a single policy for all the Member States.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
1924	[[I]] would like to focus quickly on 111 and 112, the two amendments which the [[rapporteur]] appeared to endorse in her opening speech, which deal with the application of the universal standards through the groundwater directive.	Amb,Female
1925	Mr [[President]], honourable [[Members]] of the European Parliament, [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], it is a great honour and privilege for [[me]] to be able to present today, on behalf of the presidency of the Council, the draft budget of the European Communities for the year 2006, as established by the Council on 15 July 2005.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb
1926	Well, – and [[I]] am addressing the [[person]] who questioned me slightly oddly on this issue – the [[people]] of Africa have asked [[us]] precisely to focus on infrastructure as a priority.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
1927	Indeed, if public [[companies]] now fail to show pension liabilities in their accounts, the [[director]] would face prison, yet national government finance [[ministers]] flout the rules daily.	Amb,Amb,Amb
1928	Moreover, European [[police]] forces are being given modern aids to combat crime, including organised crime such as [[child]] pornography, the drugs trade, terrorism and trafficking in [[women]] and [[children]] for the purposes of prostitution.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
1929	By rallying round the systematic [[detractors]] of Tunisia, such as Mrs [[Flautre]], and by attacking a country which, [[I]] repeat, has been exemplary, this [[House]] will convey the impression that it seeks, under cover of cooperation and respect for human rights, to harden positions on both sides, which will ultimately foster Islamic fundamentalism.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
1930	Specifically, thanks to the introduction of certain amendments that [[we]] have worked on in conjunction with the [[rapporteur]], his report leaves open the possibility of a future evaluation of a greater number of official European languages, without prejudicing the teaching of the other languages not evaluated by the indicator.	Amb,Male
1931	This incident and all the others perpetrated by the LTTE and the [[government]] need further investigation by an independent human rights [[expert]].	Amb,Amb
1932	[[I]] should like to focus on just a few points. From the outset, one critical point was Article 14 on authorised economic [[operators]], about which Mrs [[Fourtou]] has spoken.	Amb,Amb,Female
1933	As Mr [[Toubon]] said, it is absolutely right to issue a strong call to all of [[us]] and particularly to the [[Commission]] in its work on a new strategy to come up with some radical, new ideas and particularly to raise the whole political profile of the single market and its importance to all of us.	Male,Amb,Amb
1934	Reform is not about rolling back valuable social advances or our social market economy; it is about equipping [[people]] to succeed in times of change, giving them the chance to take control of their own lives.	Amb
1935	If [[we]] want female [[prisoners]] to be able to reintegrate into society and have a more stable life following their time in prison, we need to provide all prisoners with opportunities to acquire basic educational skills.	Amb,Female
1936	Now, however, a new situation has arisen, in which the [[unions]] and the [[hauliers]] have reached an agreement.	Amb,Amb
1937	[[author]] of the draft opinion of the Committee on [[Women's]] Rights and Gender Equality. - (PL) Mr [[President]], raising the quality of life of the [[citizens]] of EU Member States lies at the heart of European integration.	Amb,Female,Male,Amb
1938	[[author]]. - (FR) Madam [[President]], I will allow Commissioner [[Borg]] some time to settle into his seat.	Amb,Female,Male
1939	So unfortunately, contrary to what [[Martin Schulz]] was saying, it is not as simple as dealing directly with the problems that many [[people]] are encountering today owing to high fuel prices, the pressures on them with regard to inflation, and decreasing wages in certain sectors.	Amb,Amb
1940	[[author]]. - (PT) This year is the 20th anniversary of the mass execution of thousands of political [[prisoners]] in Tehran jails.	Amb,Amb
1941	As a university [[lecturer]], I understand that Europe needs more [[researchers]] in order to improve its productivity and competitiveness, especially in light of competition from other large economies at world level such as the United States and Japan, as well as other developing economies like India and China.	Amb,Amb
1942	[[rapporteur]]. - (IT) [[Madam President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], this is my third report on the application of Community law and I must say that - with all due respect for the considerable amount of work that [[we]] have done, together with the [[Commission]] - I do not think that we can declare ourselves to be particularly satisfied.	Amb,Female,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
1943	In addition, it is a great pity that Mrs [[Gräßle]], in particular, is the person who unnecessarily makes the work of the non-attached [[Members]] more difficult, discriminates against [[us]], prevents us from accessing information, does not allow us the opportunity to work with [[employees]] and then feels that it is worthwhile attacking us on the basis of incorrect facts.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
1944	It is important, however, that the [[Council]] and [[Commission]] get the message from [[Parliament]] that [[we]] support the inclusion of the northern bluefin [[tuna]] in CITES Appendix I. [[I]] would have preferred it if the three conditions created by the [[plenary]] had not been included, but I did support the amendment that proposed support for the affected fishing [[communities]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
1945	Apparently, there were some irregularities in the granting of drilling permits by the United States Interior [[Secretary]].	Amb
1946	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[I]] wonder what we have to fear by telling the truth and aiming to establish rules that are equal for [[all]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
1947	[[I]] still have my doubts about the feasibility of this proposal, as a mandatory [[government]] information strategy would still be stronger than the government monitoring [[companies']] policies.	Amb,Amb,Amb
1948	[[She]] has more courage than all the male [[Commissioners]] combined, as she dared to oppose Mr [[Sarkozy]], even though Mr [[Barroso]] had tried to dissuade her from doing so for a long time.	Female,Male,Male,Male
1949	It is not only because of this ethical imperative that is etched in the genetic code of the European Union that [[we]] should do this, Mr [[President]], but also in our own interests: because there is no point travelling first class if there is a [[passenger]] in economy with a bomb in his suitcase.	Amb,Male,Male
1950	The [[Commissioner]] here today has more experience than most of [[us]] in dealing with Russia, and no doubt will have his own experience there, but [[I]] hope that the Commission will put pressure on the [[High Representative]] to adopt a new policy towards any country whose [[leaders]] constantly flout the values we hold dear.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
1951	[[I]] will die before too long, he said, but meanwhile I will try to change unjust legislation as much as I can.	Male
1952	For that should be the focus of today's debate, so that [[we]] can ensure, on behalf of the [[public]], that a form of energy that is still the main component of the energy mix in most European countries - and will certainly remain so over the next few years until a sustainable, renewable and non-CO2 emitting energy source can replace it and meet our [[society's]] electricity needs - is as safe as it can possibly be.	Amb,Amb,Amb
1953	The equation is a very simple one: if it were possible to put every small and medium-sized [[enterprise]] in a position to take on just one [[employee]], [[we]] should have resolved the number one problem of the European Union, that is the revitalization of the job market.	Amb,Amb,Amb
1954	[[I]] thank the [[Commissioner]] for his answer.	Amb,Male
1955	Then [[we]] will enthusiastically support Mrs [[van Lancker's]] report!	Amb,Female
1956	Mr [[Varela]], [[I]] am not sure to what extent this is a point of order and not purely a point of semantics, however, at any rate, I have been lax enough to allow you to speak and I thank you for your information, as I have noted Mrs [[Bonino]] has thanked you, with her customary grace.	Male,Amb,Female
1957	Standing up for [[human]] rights is best served if the EU treats the Asian countries more as equal, [[adult]] countries.	Amb,Amb
1958	In those circumstances, [[I]] am sure any [[lawyer]] or [[parliamentarian]] would acknowledge that there would be extreme difficulty in trying to demonstrate that a Member State [[government]] was not upholding its duty under the terms of the Treaty.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
1959	On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party to express very sincere thanks to Mr [[Oostlander]] and Mr [[Barón Crespo]] for their difficult and excellent work!	Male,Male
1960	[[I]] should also like to say that the fact that two [[Members]] of the European Parliament have now to leave the Labour Party in order to speak freely, one sitting with the [[Communists]] and one with the [[Greens]] - one who told me this morning that he was expelled by fax - suggests to me that the control-freak tendencies of the Labour Party are now becoming known to [[people]] in Europe as a whole.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
1961	Mrs [[Lindholm]], firstly, [[I]] am sorry that I did not see you earlier.	Female,Amb
1962	[[I]] thank the honourable [[Member]] for her question and recognize the difficulties [[those]] involved in the Els Pins Park dispute have faced over their properties, but I regret it is not for the [[Council]] to intervene in cases which are pending before national criminal [[courts]].	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
1963	The current [[Commission]] demonstrates varying levels of rigour: at the will of Mr [[Van Miert]], it niggles over public aid and suspicions of distortion of competition, but it is more than reserved, if not silent, when it comes to implicating certain Member States.	Amb,Male
1964	Mr [[Morris]] has the floor on a point of order.	Male
1965	The European [[Parliament]] and the [[Council]] are easing their conscience on the cheap because, besides domestic violence and violence connected to sexual exploitation, [[we]] should also acknowledge the growth of social violence which results from the increase in poverty and from the growing destitution amongst the working [[classes]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb

1982	[[He]] was close to many [[people]] in power, most notably [[Fisher]] (who left retirement to return to his former position as First Sea Lord soon after the start of the conflict), [[Lloyd George]], and [[Winston Churchill]], and he enjoyed considerable influence during this period.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb

2059	[[We]] welcome the recent decision by the Turkish [[Minister]] of Justice to postpone the transfer of [[prisoners]] to F-type prisons, which were well described by the honourable [[Member]], for an indefinite period of time and his wish to reach what [[I]] understand is called a "social compromise" on this question.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
2060	Hopefully, by the time [[we]] come around to another cycle of these procedures, Mr [[Miller]] and [[I]] will not be here late on a Tuesday evening, talking about the technical details of heaters, tyres or whatever it is, but we will have had a chance to make an overall political input into the scope of motor vehicle regulation.	Amb,Male,Amb
2061	In conclusion, [[I]] would like to pay tribute to the rapporteurs, Mr [[Méndez de Vigo]] and Mr [[Seguro]], for their excellent report.	Amb,Male,Male
2062	The Alleanza Nazionale [[group]] has frequently denounced the urgent need to intervene and impose strict controls and prohibitions on the Internet, which represents one of the main channels of communication and distribution of both audio and video [[child]] pornography, making the service [[provider]] criminally responsible for the content of the services provided.	Amb,Amb,Amb
2063	Mrs [[Lynne]], of course [[I]] understand what you are saying, but in any case, and you are well aware of this, it is not because [[we]] are bringing voting time forward by half an hour that your report cannot be dealt with in the morning.	Female,Amb,Amb
2064	When it comes to the issue of whether or not Eurojust should be mentioned in this context, it has emerged that many [[people]] interpret the wording in terms of a desire to upset the balance of power between the [[executive]] and the [[judiciary]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
2065	The [[citizen]] and his [[employer]] could thus choose the most successful and best suited scheme, bringing the best interest rates, while offering full security of investment.	Male,Amb
2066	Although I utterly devote myself to Parliament - I think that I, like several other [[Members]], have a 100% attendance record - it is due to a constant desire for dialogue, because I am a firm believer in seeking consensus, perhaps because I think that a victory where one' [[s opponent]] is crushed is a defeat in the sense that the victory always contains an element of the war in the offing.	Amb,Amb
2067	My question is the same as Mrs [[Riis-Jørgensen's]].	Female
2068	Unfortunately, Mr [[Oostlander's]] report contains amendments which restrict the purpose of the framework decision.	Male
2069	As [[you]] can see, this proposal is, therefore, different. Both in the amounts in question and the type of interventions envisaged, it differs from the emergency [[victim]] aid system that existed between 1977 and 1996.	Amb,Amb
2070	If a [[politician]] expresses noxious views, it should be up to his [[constituents]] to remove him, not the [[courts]], let alone his political [[opponents]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb

2076	[[I]] would like to end by thanking Mr [[Karas]], who has done a commendable job, for his attitude and his work.	Amb,Male
2077	Mr [[President]], first of all, [[I]] should like to add my own thanks to the [[rapporteur]] for all the work she – together with the other [[Members]] – has done, but I should nevertheless like to make a few observations concerning the proposal on which [[we]] will be voting later.	Male,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
2078	Then [[I]] remembered something that happened in London, where a [[pensioner]], who had not received her pension in her post-box, since it had been removed by the UK post office, was found dead a few months later because she could no longer collect her pension.	Amb,Female

Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb
2083	As the German Presidency comes to an end, [[I]] start by congratulating the [[Chancellor]] on her very successful pursuit of the climate change agenda over the past six months.	Amb,Female
2084	This question is addressed not only to [[you]] but also to the [[President]] of the Parliament and the [[President]] of the European Commission.	Amb,Amb,Amb
2085	On the first EU anti-trafficking day which was on 18 October 2007, GLS issued recommendations on [[victim]] identification and referral services.	Amb
2086	(FR) Mr [[President]], [[President-in-Office]] of the Council, like the [[President]] of the European Parliament, like many other fellow [[Members]], I am a child of the ruins of the Second World War, and I very much appreciate the dedication that you therefore put in your speech, which flouts scepticism.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
2087	This [[Commission]] - as [[you]] know - has the highest number of women [[commissioners]] ever.	Amb,Amb,Female
2088	Firstly, two [[Members]], one of whom was Mr [[Batten]], mentioned specific examples of how [[citizens]] are affected - perhaps in another country - and it is their opinion that conditions are not very good.	Male,Male,Amb
2089	The ECR [[Group]] feel that this resolution takes a '[[victim]]-centred approach' which prescribes how Member States should look after victims once they have been trafficked, thus assuming that the incidence of human trafficking is inevitable.	Amb,Amb
2090	(EL) Mr [[President]], Lady [[Ashton]], we [[socialists]] and [[democrats]] believe in a European Union with a strong presence on the international stage, a Union with a common foreign policy which can speak with one voice in what is becoming a more and more complex world, a Union with a separate defence identity, which gives it independence of choice and action and a particular role in the international sphere.	Male,Female,Amb,Amb
2091	[[rapporteur]] for the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - (HU) Madam [[President]], as one of the [[representatives]] of the LIBE Committee, I would like to join [[those]] congratulating the [[rapporteurs]], and would like to thank the [[Commission]] for its work, as well as Mr [[Šefčovič]] and Mr [[Chastel]] for their work in the Council, as they contributed considerably to the creation of a sound and viable text which truly represents a step towards simplification, and which I believe will gain extensive support.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Male
2092	Mr [[President]], I visited Albania as a [[journalist]] on several occasions in the 1990s.	Male,Amb
2093	This is an important task, because better industry terms would allow the EU to become a global market [[leader]] in this area.	Amb
2094	[[I]] should like, while of course keeping to both the subject matter of the [[Commission's]] communication and the main arguments of the [[rapporteur]], to call the executive Commission's attention to the question of freeze-dried plasmas. This is a method of preservation which is quite effective but which nevertheless, because of the long time it allows specimens to be kept, has created and perpetuated a number of risks in transfusions.	Amb,Amb,Amb
2095	It does not consider the fact that the Community standards represent a policy-orientation framework, which must, among others, also take due account of the rights of the individual European [[citizen]] and also, for instance, of environmental and public health concerns.	Amb
2096	Mr [[President]], [[I]] wish to congratulate the [[rapporteur]] on her rapid work.	Male,Amb,Female
2097	Mrs [[Matikainen-Kallström]], the rapporteur, whom [[I]] warmly thank for her report, has described its past history.	Female,Amb

2099	[[I]] think the time has come for the [[Commission]] to harmonize [[artists']] intellectual property rights in their work through resale right.	Amb,Amb,Amb
2100	However, [[I]] should like to take up one point which has already been raised by other [[speakers]], especially Mr [[Dell'Alba]], and that is whether the [[Commission]] is capable of executing its own budget?	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
2101	Lastly - once again [[I]] am addressing Mrs [[Müller]] - the [[Commission]] decided to open an administrative inquiry once the UCLAF report had been completed.	Amb,Female,Amb
2102	In order to express our support to [[all]] who fight, risking their lives against terrorism, my [[group]] similarly proposes that our [[Parliament]] send a [[delegation]] to Algeria to meet the [[members]] of parliament as well as all the [[forces]] who are courageously struggling in that country.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
2103	Madam [[President]], [[I]] am not going to repeat what Mr [[Linkohr]] and Mrs [[McNally]] have explained so well to [[us]].	Female,Amb,Male,Female,Amb
2104	But whilst sharing the pleasure of finally finding, once again, a certain leeway in the freedom of establishment, [[I]] still wonder why a [[lawyer]] would register at the Bar of another Member State whose law he does not know.	Amb,Male
2105	However, before [[we]] start, Mr [[Smith]] has asked for the floor on a point of order.	Amb,Male
2106	Firstly, Mrs [[Lenz]] and [[others]] talked about the possibility of there being one [[Commissioner]] in charge.	Female,Amb,Amb
2107	Mr [[President]], this will not sound very original, because [[I]] too would like to congratulate the [[rapporteur]] on his excellent and very comprehensive work, and say that the Group of the European Radical Alliance absolutely shares his point of view on budgetarization of the EDF, on improving the visibility of European aid and its political advantages, on internal coherence, which is still inadequate, between the instruments and various types of action, and our various areas of intervention, and finally on ensuring that the development aid policy and other European policies are more complementary!	Male,Amb,Male
2108	Madam [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], in contrast to the previous [[speaker]], whose task on behalf of his [[committee]] was to highlight the economic aspects of cooperation within the Customs Union, the [[Committee]] on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs has to examine the Customs Union from a different perspective, namely in terms of the human rights situation and the development of democracy in Turkey.	Female,Female,Male,Male,Amb,Amb
2109	[[I]] apologise that I am not Mr [[Virgin]], but I am presenting the report in his name.	Amb,Male
2110	On the other hand, today, a report by five [[people]] representing no-one but themselves, yet nonetheless elevated to the status of 'wise men', led to the resignation of the European Commission on 15 March 1999.	Male
2111	Voting on a report by Mrs [[d'Ancona]] on drugs and drug addiction has become something of an institution in this House.	Female
2112	That will mean that as of next year, two of the [[Court's]] 15 [[members]] will be women, which is an improvement but still not enough.	Amb,Female

2234	It is one [[child]], then a second [[child]], then a third [[child]], then a fourth; each of them not just a child, but [[somebody's]] child; each a funeral that should never have happened; each a life that could be saved - a tragedy, [[I]] believe, that strikes at the very soul of my being and [[yours]].

2371	Thirdly, and as set out in the motion for a resolution on Iraq by [[members]] of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, it is important for the European Union to be extremely active in its support for the transformation of Iraq in various fields, on the premise that Iraq is our joint responsibility, the joint responsibility of all [[Europeans]] and that of the entire European Union.	Amb,Amb
2372	[[We]] are also pleased about the reference made by the [[rapporteur]], whom [[I]] take this opportunity to congratulate on his excellent report, to the fact that, following discussions with interest [[groups]], he was able to conclude that both [[workers]] and the industry – the [[Commissioner]] referred to this – not only consent to the introduction of a harmonised Community air traffic controller licence, but even welcome it.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb

2378	[[I]] took part in the discussions on these various reports in the [[Committee]] on the Environment but it seemed to me that what Mrs [[Klaß]] has just presented was not the report that the committee had approved unanimously, but rather a reflection of her personal position.	Amb,Amb,Female

2393	Mr [[President]], with respect to my [[colleague]], it is actually not satisfactory because as he knows - and if he spent as much time in the Human Rights [[Subcommittee]] as [[I]] do, he would - it is in [[committees]] that [[we]] actually get a chance to have more than one say and more than one minute, and then we actually get a direct response.

Male,Amb,Amb
2396	As the rapporteur, Mr [[Virgin]], has observed in his own amendments and as stated in [[Parliament's]] earlier standpoint, the rules laid down by the EU concerning hazardous waste currently fall short of the requirements of the Basel Convention.	Male,Amb
2397	Mr [[Desama]], [[we]] could talk about technical things, the single [[buyer]], the opening of the market segment by segment, access of third [[parties]], even about the eligibility of [[distributors]] which was rejected by two votes in the [[committee]], as has been the case, moreover, with the whole of this text.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
2398	Why so much hot air about labels, pacts, stability, greater or less flexibility of criteria and sanctions, while ignoring reality, social issues, unemployment, life - not single currencies and central [[banks]]?	Amb

Amb,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
2502	The case of the Guantánamo Bay [[prisoners]] is the most flagrant illustration of the fact that the USA does not respect fundamental rights, insofar as it has brought these men before special courts and completely violated their right to defence.	Male

Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb

2519	At the halfway mark, as Mrs [[Kinnock's]] report correctly says, the Millennium Goals have yet to be given due priority by European [[governments]] and the [[Commission]].	Female,Amb,Amb
2520	The study [[we]] presented recently with Mr [[Virrankoski]] on the implementation of the Structural Funds highlights the considerable time it has taken the [[Commission]] to approve the national frameworks and operational programmes, so there are now record outstanding commitments of three years; by taking this firm stance on the reserve, we wanted to raise the alarm.	Amb,Male,Amb
2521	[[We]] also hope that your fantastic Environment [[Minister]] will have much greater room for manoeuvre in your [[government]] than she has now.	Amb,Female,Amb
2522	This is a subject, however, that [[I]] believe should continue to engage [[us]] and [[others]] - as the [[Commissioner]] has already said, and I have noted it - because the numbers are terrifying.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
2523	But [[I]] am glad the [[Commissioner]] has said he is considering what may be further desirable, so long as whatever is proposed is always practicable for EU industry and for [[exporters]] to the EU.	Amb,Male,Amb

2538	[[Commissioner]], just like you, [[we]] want to stick to the procedure ensuring that this entire process is conducted correctly, and we await the final opinion of the Venice Commission, although it is now clear from the preliminary conclusions presented in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs by the Secretary of the Venice Commission, Mr [[Markert]], that the current Hungarian constitution is, in a number of points, controversial to say the least.	Amb,Amb,Male
2539	Mr [[Cabrol]], in reply to your question as to whether a health observatory should be set up, [[I]] would say that this would make no difference at all to the situation [[we]] are faced with regarding BSE.	Male,Amb,Amb
2540	Madam [[President]], [[Commissioner]], Mr [[President-in-Office]], [[I]] have asked to speak for just one simple reason, not to repeat what many of my [[colleagues]] have said about our position, the difficulties, the outlook and so forth, but to raise an issue I have already raised once in the [[Committee]] on External Economic Affairs with Commissioner [[van den Broek]] present, and which is fleetingly covered in the Mendiluce report.	Female,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
2541	Our task, your task, Mrs [[Cresson]], and ours as the European Parliament is to discuss this matter with the [[researchers]]: what do we want, what is the purpose of research, what is the ethical responsibility of research in our [[society]]?	Female,Amb,Amb
2542	Mrs [[Green]], to my knowledge, it is indeed what the agenda for the week stipulates, in any case, since it is what [[I]] have seen in it.	Female,Amb

2545	Nevertheless, the [[Chair]] allowed [[you]] could express your opinion by using the explanation of vote for a different vote, which is equivalent to a flagrant breach of the Rules of Procedure.	Amb,Amb
2546	[[I]] want to say to the [[rapporteur]] and Mr [[Eisma]] that there is a problem in the fact that [[we]] transport [[calves]] from Denmark to the Netherlands to be fattened up, after which they are transported back again.	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
2547	Commissioner [[Van den Broek]], and my remarks are also addressed to Commissioner [[Kinnock]], [[we]] simply must devise a new system for informing [[Parliament]] of the negotiations which the Commission logically is required to conduct. This sort of communication problem between Parliament and Commission cannot be allowed to continue.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
2548	The [[victim]] should know that even then there is, somewhere on earth, a [[court]] which can administer justice and which can restore to the suffering victim his dignity and punish the guilty [[party]].	Male,Amb,Amb
2549	But is such a distinction possible when seen from the Koran's holistic perspective, a perspective which states that the Islamic faith is inseparable from a religious way of life? It is indeed a culture but it is also a body of political legislation, a [[family]] code and so on, and it is the duty of the [[faithful]] to live by these rules as soon as they have the means to do so.	Amb,Amb
2550	[[We]] were unable to support Mr [[Swoboda's]] report as it offers no way out of these dangerous ambiguities.	Amb,Male

2636	The three cases [[I]] have mentioned are also quite important because they reflect remarkably on four current [[Commissioners]].	Amb,Amb
2637	Madam [[President]], [[we]] are usually very quick to criticise the [[Commission]] or the [[Council]] when they do not attend our debates, but this time, ironically, the finger seems to be pointing the other way.

2646	The problem of immigration is, at this moment, common to all European countries, and Commissioner [[Vitorino]], in carrying out the work on the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy, is moving in the right direction.	Amb

2650	Mr [[President]], first of all [[I]] would like to thank the European [[institutions]] for the solidarity they have shown towards the [[people]] and regions affected and I would also like to thank the parliamentary [[groups]] that supported [[us]] in holding a debate, as Mr [[Haarder]] pointed out, on 21 November, and in repeating it today.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Male
2651	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] wish to begin by thanking the previous [[speaker]] for his words because this is actually a point that [[we]] consider to be extremely important in this context.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Male,Amb
2652	The [[Eurosceptics]] are right to fear the single currency, because [[no one]] can question the fact that participating in a common currency involves the greatest possible degree of integration.	Amb,Amb
2653	The honourable gentleman Mr [[Salafranca]] knows a huge amount about the subject, but my sympathies and my intellect on this occasion are with some of those who spoke in the later stages of the debate, who also know a huge amount about development assistance: the honourable lady Mrs [[Kinnock]], the honourable gentleman Mr [[Whitehead]], and the honourable gentleman and my honourable friend, Mr [[Deva]].	Male,Female,Male,Male
2654	[[I]] urge you to be flexible between now and when the vote is taken, Mr [[Hatzidakis]].	Amb,Male
2655	– Madam [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], Mr [[Barroso]], I am a [[journalist]] who has been prevented from continuing to do his job.	Female,Female,Male,Male,Male

2657	The vast majority of [[Members]] of this House, [[myself]] included, will be glad to see Bulgaria and Romania join the EU, and eagerly await the day when they will be able to do so.	Amb,Amb
2658	Well, here's a real gem from the document: ‘Too often, elections become a source of conflict, because the losing [[side]] does not accept defeat.’	Amb
2659	Mr [[President]], Mrs [[Martens]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], obviously [[I]] should like first of all to welcome most of the interventions, because they really are very much in line with the convictions underlying my communication on Africa.	Male,Female,Female,Male,Amb
2660	Some of our fellow [[Members]], such as Mr [[Cohn-Bendit]], go as far as to want to ban the [[people]] of Poland from de-Communising their country.	Male,Male,Amb
2661	For these reasons, [[adult]] education in the new Member States is both a chance to make amends for the weaknesses of the socialist model of education outlined above and at the same time a genuine opening up to the world.	Amb
2662	On behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, [[I]] should also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mrs [[Niebler]], for her excellent cooperation.	Amb,Female
2663	[[rapporteur]] for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - Madam [[President]], I would just like to focus on the microcredit issue, which the Committee on Budgets completely supports as it will help [[people]] without access to normal sources of funds - the very sort of people who need help in the current environment.	Amb,Female,Amb
2664	Mr [[President]], honourable [[Members]], [[I]] would like to start by thanking Mrs [[Estrela]] and Mrs [[Lulling]] for their report.	Male,Amb,Amb,Female,Female
2665	Sanctioning the [[government]] or reducing the level of our contacts would do nothing for the [[poorest]] and most [[vulnerable]] and would only embolden [[those]] who pay lip service to democracy.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
2666	The EU has to be a community of cultural values in which diversity is an asset, and a factor in unity and cohesion, or, as the [[rapporteur]] puts it, 'an instrument for global peace and stability'.	Amb
2667	[[I]] should like to make a general remark, given that Mr [[Cox]] and Mr [[Watson]] have referred to much more specific subjects.	Amb,Male,Male
2668	These competences overlap, but they are also complementary, and in fact the [[Commission]] has never had any difficulty in coordinating the various services responsible. The [[Commissioners]] also work well together in this area.	Amb,Amb
2669	There are a number of concrete steps being taken and [[I]] should say in response to the honourable [[Member]] that his question actually specified Hungary and Poland and that the response, as he would expect, was prepared in conjunction with Mr [[van den Broek]], so there is no inconsistency between responses he has previously received and the one that I just gave him.	Amb,Male,Male
2670	A Member called [[Féret]], a representative of the Front National, called both Mrs [[Green]] and [[myself]] fascists.	Amb,Female,Amb
2671	There is something very curious going on here where the [[director]] of the centre said in 1995 that this would be possible by 1998 and yet the [[Commission]] has not come up with any proposals.	Amb,Amb
2672	These will be reflected in the positions on proposals with regard to the African [[elephant]], the [[white rhino]], [[tigers]] and [[whales]], and many other important issues before the Conference of the [[Parties]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
2673	Concerning the position of the European Union on the situation of civil war in Sri Lanka, the honourable [[Member]] could usefully refer to the replies to questions that she herself raised during the sessions of last May and July.	Female
2674	And suddenly the efforts are achievable, to an extent that no [[member]] of the follow-up [[committee]], in any [[group]], had believed possible six months ago.	Amb,Amb,Amb
2675	[[I]] am sure that in preparing this opinion [[Parliament]] will want to consider the employment issues the honourable [[Member]] raises in her question.	Amb,Amb,Female
2676	Mrs [[McKenna]], your report has stirred things up a bit in Flanders and has caused the talks on a new fertiliser decree to move up a gear.	Female
2677	More generally, the report on the Statute of the [[Members]] of the European Parliament has come at just the right time.	Amb
2678	But [[I]] would have liked to have heard from the [[Commissioner]], and this is my final point, when he thinks the [[Council]] will grant its approval.	Amb,Male,Amb

2752	However, [[I]] would ask [[you]], in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community, to make representations, using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent, to the [[President]] and to the Governor of Texas, Mr [[Bush]], who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned [[person]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
2753	[[I]] particularly welcome the fact that [[we]] are training domestic [[observers]] - I think that is very important and will offset the likelihood of [[Mugabe]] criticising us for coming in in a neo-colonialist way to interfere in his election.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male

2757	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[I]] should like to begin by thanking the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for its report, and also by thanking the rapporteur, Mr [[Jové Peres]], for his excellent input.	Male,Amb,Amb,Male

2759	[[I]] shudder to think about the situation of that one [[Member]] of Parliament who does not belong to the government party in an assembly of 79 seats, but I imagine that if any opposition [[Member]] were elected in these elections - which will not happen - he would probably soon be sent from Parliament to jail.	Amb,Male,Male
2760	[[I]] offer you my sincere congratulations, Mr [[Cox]], on your election and my best wishes for the performance of your duties, for a term of office which is fruitful and beneficial to the European Parliament.	Amb,Male
2761	Every year [[we]] receive more than 3 000 foreign [[students]].	Amb,Amb
2762	Nonetheless, your comments have been noted, as were Mr [[Watson's]].	Male
2763	These priorities are set against a background of wholesale implementation of the recommendations set out in the [[Commission]] report on historic clarification which Mrs [[González Álvarez]] referred to and which is of crucial importance.	Amb,Female
2764	Unlike Mrs [[Díez González]], [[I]] do not think so.	Female,Amb
2765	Then Mr [[Watson]] would be the rector of the college, Mrs [[Reding]] would be the faithful wife, you, Vice-President [[Provan]], could only be the Scottish millionaire and, lastly, Mrs [[Plooij-van Gorsel]] would be the beautiful blonde.	Male,Female,Amb,Female

2767	In an extreme case [[someone]] in Khabarovsk in eastern Russia would have to give his address with his ticket in the hope that everything would be forwarded to a central Russian office which would then send everything on to the Lithuanian [[authorities]], which would in turn have to process everything on time, so that when the [[passenger]] on board the train arrives at the border the Lithuanian border [[official]] would hopefully have the transit permit for that passenger with him.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb
2768	After some hesitation, [[we]] are glad that the Greek [[Presidency]], during the most recent consultation with [[Parliament]], undertook to make available to Parliament all the information that had initially been withheld, including that on costs and [[personnel]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
2769	[[I]] think that [[Parliament]] - through the voices of the Chairman of the Committee, Mr [[Hernández Mollar]], and very large numbers of fellow [[Members]] - has indicated the minimum conditions which are required by Parliament and which really must be fulfilled.	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
2770	As Mr [[Bowis]] and other fellow [[Members]] have already stated, it is perfectly clear, looking at the current situation, that that regime is unacceptable.	Male,Amb
2771	[[I]] congratulate Mr [[De Rossa]] on his excellent report and the way in which he presented it today.	Amb,Male
2772	This disruption is especially extensive to [[animals]] that by nature have very sensitive acoustic capabilities, such as [[whales]] and [[dolphins]].	Amb,Amb,Amb

2774	[[She]] is an [[official]] of the European Commission and will act as a contact point for SMEs, maintain a dialogue with SMEs and ensure that their interests are properly considered within all EU policies and programmes.	Female,Female
2775	This was why the [[Committee]] on Employment and Social Affairs underlined the importance of economic development in facilitating social inclusion during its debates on the report, and indeed the [[Commissioner]] also stressed this aspect of the issue a short while ago.	Amb,Amb
2776	[[I]] should like to take this opportunity today to share my memories of our dear [[colleague]], who was a magnificent, honest and good-natured man, as well as a social activist and a patriot.	Amb,Male
2777	[[We]] must do everything that we can to oppose the exploitation of [[children]] in the developing world.	Amb,Amb
2778	In addition to a large number of [[unemployed]] and working [[poor]], one female [[pensioner]] in four lives in poverty in the United Kingdom.	Amb,Amb,Female
2779	It was worthy of criticism not least in that a competent [[candidate]] was required to withdraw because he held fast to his conservative religious convictions, while an incompetent [[Stalinist]] remained in office.	Male,Amb
2780	[[I]] agree with Mr [[Winkler]] that long-term efforts will be required in order to bring about democracy in Belarus, and [[we]] must persist with those efforts after the election.	Amb,Male,Amb
2781	The PSE [[Group]] would also draw your attention to the appeal made by the [[Mayor]] of Diyarbakir to those [[Kurds]] who use violence, to abandon this strategy, because my group emphatically denounces excessive violence.	Amb,Amb,Amb
2782	Mr [[President]], Mrs [[Hübner]], Mr [[Špidla]], Mr [[Manninen]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] can testify to the vigour and richness of the exchanges of the last few months and the last two years, which have resulted today in texts that my [[colleagues]] and I think and hope will in a moment be adopted by the European Parliament by a very large majority.	Male,Female,Male,Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
2783	Special thanks go to our rapporteur, Mr [[Rübig]], and the chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mrs [[Niebler]].	Male,Female
2784	[[I]] was promised that this would disappear and it has been brought back by the [[Commission]] - a disgraceful question which no [[woman]] should be asked to put up with.	Female,Amb,Female
2785	What should be done if [[candidates]] of extremist parties are elected, if such parties win seats?	Amb
2786	in writing. - (FI) Mr [[President]], [[I]] wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs [[Flautre]], for a balanced and worthy report, whose insistence on the re-evaluation of EU sanctions and research as part of the EU's wider human rights policy is only right and proper.	Male,Amb,Female
2787	It is easy to condemn Israel, because it is a [[member]] of the UN.	Amb
2788	Its purpose should be to ensure that a [[citizen's]] right to health care in another Member State is carefully framed, so that each Member State's capacity to fund and organise its domestic services is not undermined by health tourism.	Amb
2789	[[rapporteur]]. - (SK) I would like to conclude today's debate by thanking both of my [[colleagues]] for their opinions.	Amb,Amb
2790	[[I]] think there is a striking lack of male [[speakers]] and I am glad that my [[group]] has been able to send two.	Amb,Male,Amb
2791	[[I]] welcome the European Union's firmness in making the issues of freedom, democracy and human rights central to its agenda for Kyrgyzstan.	Amb
2792	This would send a clear message to the [[Council]] about what [[Europeans]] want, which is nothing more than to live in an area of security and justice, to be protected, and for a [[victim]] who has a restraining order against her [[aggressor]] in her country not to have to begin further court proceedings when she moves to another country.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
2793	The [[Greens]] believe the final compromise allows Member States to establish a reasonable system of prior authorisation for the reimbursement of treatment costs, with [[MEPs]] succeeding in limiting the list of reasons for which a [[patient]] can be refused cross-border treatment.	Amb,Amb,Amb
2794	It needs to send out clear messages, such as the one [[we]] were expecting from Baroness [[Ashton]].	Amb,Female
2795	[[I]] also wanted to remind [[you]] that 22 June, in two weeks' time, will be the 70th anniversary of the attack on the Soviet Union by [[Hitler's]] Germany.	Amb,Amb,Amb
2796	It concerns instead a statement made in 2004, long before she was elected a [[Member]] of this House.	Female
2797	[[We]] have inherited the fifty years which is now drawing to a close from the forwardlooking political courage of the [[statesmen]] who planned and built up the Community of peace and progress.	Amb,Male
2798	If you are a [[hunter]], you do not hunt game during the breeding season, and the same principle should in fact be introduced in fisheries.	Amb
2799	Some dodgy [[character]] has procured these smoke alarm rods, packed a whole lot of them into a suitcase and pretended he had something to sell.	Male
2800	And the [[people]] in charge of the system, with all due respect to the preceding [[speaker]], are the British government on the one hand and the [[Commission]] in Brussels on the other.	Amb,Amb,Amb
2801	A fairly prominent SPD [[figure]] once said: ' There is no such thing as SPD economic policy or CDU economic policy...' - and [[I]] am not quoting a [[Liberal]] but an SPD [[supporter]] because I think the [[Member]] concerned would find him more credible, although now [[you]] do not seem to like this either - anyway, in my view this man quite rightly said: ' There is no such thing as SPD, CDU or FDP economic policy, there is only a wrong or a right economic policy.'	Male,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
2802	Because, in truth, it is primarily for political [[minorities]] that liberties should be granted and defended.	Amb
2803	[[We]] also brought in a technical [[expert]], whom [[many]] describe as the king of decoders, if [[you]] do not find that description a little over-the-top, and that technical expert made it absolutely clear in the talks we had with both [[parties]] to the dispute that both systems are open, although they use different technologies and that the fact that it is necessary to negotiate in the case of the one system does not mean preclude a fair outcome.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
2804	Sport is the first way in which a young [[person]] can find out about himself and respect his body, and will enable him later on to respect [[adversaries]] and the rules of life in society, develop his energy in a [[team]], regardless of origin, education or language, and to forge links within the European Union.	Male,Amb,Amb
2805	Given that its [[author]] is absent, Question No 42 lapses.	Amb
2806	In conclusion, the most difficult job for the President-in-Office, Mr [[Junker]], will be to find a compromise between different ideological approaches to economic organization.	Male
2807	[[We]] expect the Council of [[Ministers]] today to approve formally the guidelines for employment policy which the [[Commission]] presented at the summit.	Amb,Amb,Amb
2808	Secondly, Madam [[Commissioner]], the report has not, in fact, given [[us]] that much information since what the [[Commission]] has done, or the Commission's services have done - as can be seen on pages 10 to 59 - is to collect the national information, put it in a file and bring it along.	Female,Amb,Amb
2809	The next item is the report (A4-0165/98) by Mrs [[Aelvoet]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a [[Council]] and [[Commission]] Decision on the signature and on the conclusion of a Euro-Mediterranean Agreement with Jordan (COM(97)0554 - C4-0171/98-97/029(AVC)).

2811	In future, the sectoral [[Councils]] must lay special emphasis on developing indicators and defining targets to be reviewed.	Amb

3015	[[Director]] of the Domaine de Kerguehennec, in France (1992–1999) Co-Director with [[Jan Hoet]] of documenta IX in Kassel, Germany (1992) General inspector for contemporary art in the French Ministry for Culture (1999) Curator of the French Pavilion at the 48th Biennale in Venice (1999) Visiting Professor at the École Supérieure des Arts Visuels (ESAV) in Geneva (1985-1991) Professor at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (1996–2005) Professor for art history and art theory at the Aegean University in Lesvos, Greece (2002-2010) Artistic director of the Macedonian Museums for Contemporary Art, Thessalonica (2006).

3016	In a magazine interview, [[Amuro]] revealed that the [[Super Monkey's]] were supposed to debut as a co-ed group with 5 female [[members]] and two male [[members]].	Amb,Amb,Female,Male
3017	Due to her popularity, [[she]] became the highest-paid teenage [[artist]] in Indonesia.	Female,Female

3019	Once a [[player]] has made his first meld, he may at any time, when it is his turn, lay off individual cards to melds already made, regardless of whether the meld was made by the player or one of his [[opponents]].	Male,Amb
3020	[[He]] then remained as the foreign [[minister]] until [[Elbegdorj's]] government had to step back in December.	Male,Male,Amb
3021	Although her identity was noted and her position as a [[Member]] of the European Parliament was very apparent, she was still held in custody all day.	Female
3022	I am a [[supporter]] of [[Strasbourg]] and a supporter of Fridays.	Amb,Amb
3023	But that means talking to [[each other]], meeting each other, analysing things pragmatically, finding compromises.	Amb
3024	The [[Commission]] plans to present a mid-term appreciation of the framework programme and its progress this autumn. [[I]] believe this is what Mrs [[Gill]] would like to see.	Amb,Amb,Female
3025	[[I]] compliment the [[rapporteur]] on her report and all the work she has put in.	Amb,Female
3026	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[I]] shall try to compensate for the fact that the previous [[speaker]] overran her time by not using all the time allocated to me.	Male,Amb,Amb,Female
3027	As far as the action the [[Commission]] has undertaken concerning the Sensus project is concerned, the Commission has initiated an internal review of the management of this project as indicated in the Commission's reply to the oral questions by the honourable [[Member]].	Amb,Amb
3028	It further implies as [[I]] said in my first speech, that in the [[Commission' s]] interpretation nominal objectives must not be considered set in stone.	Amb,Amb
3029	[[I]] should also like to thank the [[rapporteur]] warmly for all her efforts to persuade [[us]] to sing from the same song sheet, but a special thanks goes to all [[those]] who have worked hard on this broadly-based text.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
3030	All in all this is a Presidency worthy of the challenge of contemporary Europe and it is a Presidency, Mr [[Verhofstadt]], which you and your [[colleagues]] can take great pride in.	Male,Amb
3031	It is clear, therefore, that the aim of granting a legal personality to the European Union, as well as the Communities, is to create a competent new [[actor]] on the international stage, which will use all the opportunities provided by Article 24 of the TEU (particularly since its revision after the Nice Summit) to gradually remove from Member States the autonomy of their foreign policy.	Amb
3032	[[I]] should like to point out to [[him]] that unfortunately I am not the [[master]] of whether I get the opportunity to put a question to him, or any other [[minister]] in this House, during the course of the debates - it is the [[group]] which decides [[who]] takes the floor.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3033	With regard to the Decree of the [[President]] of the Republic of Czechoslovakia of 19 May 1945 'concerning the invalidity of transactions involving property rights from the time of the oppression and concerning the national administration of property assets of [[Germans]], [[Magyars]], [[traitors]] and [[collaborationists]] and of certain [[organisations]] and [[associations]]' (Benes Decree), will the [[Commission]] say whether that decree is still in force and whether any census has been conducted in the Czech Republic since 8 May 1946?	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3034	This leads [[me]] on to a rather sensitive aspect of the EBRD's activity - an aspect of which the [[institutions']] top [[echelons]] are aware, as I well know - which is the risk that EBRD funding may squeeze out private risk capital and the development of endogenous credit in these countries.	Amb,Amb,Amb
3035	There is one [[Member]] who has given it as his opinion that it is unfair to impose conditions applicable only to Austria.	Male
3036	The analysis is harsh and cruel and, Mrs [[Peijs]], [[we]] have to take it on board: every day there are 7 500 km of traffic jams on Europe's roads; between 1990 and 1998, CO2 emissions increased by 15%; the amount of freight transported by rail has declined in recent years from 21% to 8.5% and between 1990 and 1996 alone, ten football fields' worth of new motorways were constructed every day.	Female,Amb
3037	What concerns the [[rapporteur]] is the gap between the intention of completing the unification of the market at European level and the reluctance of the national States.	Amb
3038	A moment ago, Mrs [[McNally]] spoke of the importance and European added value of the space sector.	Female
3039	The office of the EU special representative for Afghanistan, Mr [[Vendrell]], has established good working relations with the Ministry for Women's Affairs and the Afghan Independent Human Rights Committee and is supporting the creation of an infrastructure of women[['s]] organisations through training and dialogue.	Male,Female
3040	Not a few [[Heads of State]] or [[Government]] would like to have things split half and half between government and [[opposition]]; perhaps the German [[Chancellor]] would in his present situation.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male
3041	Consequently, any [[politician]] who speaks for or against this [[organisation]] and wants to enter into the fundamental debate about abortion, does complete justice to the objectives of this [[women’s]] organisation.	Amb,Amb,Female
3042	Madam [[President]], Mr [[Solana]], [[I]] am genuinely delighted at the statements made by Mr Solana and Mr [[Patten]] on Georgia.	Female,Male,Amb,Male
3043	Many fine words have been said about this; but how is it possible, Mr [[President]], that [[we]] were saying here so soon after the tragic attack in your native Spain that the security services really must now enhance their cooperation – indeed, that is what we had said on 11 September 2001 – that that energy now seems to be ebbing away again, and that it is again considered less important?	Male,Amb
3044	On a recent visit to the country [[we]] found that schools, where there is a ratio of 15 [[pupils]] to one [[teacher]], are the envy of Europe.	Amb,Amb,Amb
3045	One of the most memorable events in the recent Olympic Games was the case of the long-distance [[athlete]] who was likely to win, but was prevented from doing so by a [[member]] of the [[crowd]] simply running out and stopping him.	Male,Amb,Amb
3046	Mr [[President]], [[I]] wish to thank the [[rapporteur]] for his work in support of the [[Commission’s]] policy and the excellent compromise he has proposed.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb
3047	Alongside Mrs [[Fischer-Boel]], [[we]] could, moreover, do slightly more to destroy our agriculture, such as it is; Mr [[Mandelson]] would obtain an agreement in Hong Kong and, for our part, we would have slightly higher levels of unemployment.	Female,Amb,Male
3048	[[I]] thank the [[Commissioner]] for his offer.	Amb,Male
3049	If [[Castro]] continues to refuse to allow the [[recipients]] of the Sakharov prize to travel to Cuba, then [[we]] should not travel to Cuba as if nothing had happened.	Amb,Amb,Amb
3050	[[We]] also carried out a great deal of consultation with the shadow [[rapporteurs]] and [[I]] would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs [[Bachelot]], Mrs [[McDonald]], Mrs [[Schroedter]] and Mr [[Beaupuy]] for their willingness to compromise and for the quality of their work.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Female,Female,Male
3051	Let [[us]] also use and support the [[employee]] code and the code of good practice for the employment of [[people]] with disabilities.	Amb,Amb,Amb
3052	[[draftsman]] of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (PL) [[Madam President]], I would like to warmly congratulate the [[rapporteur]], and thank her for all the work undertaken on an issue of such great importance for the future of the European economy.	Male,Female,Female
3053	[[draftsman]] of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (DE) [[Madam President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would like to begin by congratulating Mr [[Langen]] on his balanced report.	Male,Female,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Male
3054	The German [[Chancellor]] may rest assured: thanks to Mr [[Sarkozy]], her Presidency of Europe will be a success!	Female,Male
3055	Amendments that do not contribute to equality and democracy for [[all]] and to solidarity with the [[poor]] and [[hungry]] of the world will not have our support.	Amb,Amb,Amb
3056	In that regard, [[I]] would like to return to what Commissioner [[McCreevy]] said yesterday: he gave the impression that if the American real estate market was in the state it was in, it was because the [[people]] taking out mortgages had no financial education.	Amb,Male,Amb
3057	(CS) Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], allow [[me]] to comment on two points in Mrs [[Thomsen's]] report.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Female
3058	To give a simple example, take a [[person]] who has to sign a car rental contract at an airport: the consumer is not able to read the content of the contract, he is unaware of the law to which the contract is subject and, unless he has legal protection he is completely in the hands of the [[person]] offering the contract.	Male,Amb
3059	[[We]] would have expected a greater increase, but on hearing the arguments put forward by Mrs [[Jeggle]] and other [[MEPs]] we supported the package of compromise amendments that talks of a voluntary increase of just 2%.	Amb,Female,Amb
3060	[[Child]] labour and prostitution have also been reported despite these countries' best efforts.	Amb
3061	[[We]] are focussing on better [[victim]] protection, not just in Germany, but in Europe.	Amb,Amb
3062	The new Czech [[Minister]] for Health - who, like her [[predecessor]], smokes - has the new proposal aimed at renewing ratification and will send it to the inter-agency process, so it will reach [[Parliament]] pretty soon.	Female,Amb,Amb
3063	[[I]] would like to hear your opinion on this subject, Mrs [[Vassiliou]], as well as your response to [[Parliament's]] request in its resolution of 27 April 2006, seeking the creation of a European observatory on natural disasters to ensure a more effective European response when these unfortunate events occur.	Amb,Female,Amb
3064	The authors of the question, Mrs [[Sargentini]], Mrs [[Ernst]], Mrs [[Thomsen]] and other [[speakers]] indicated the importance of [[victim]] protection, which normally refers, above all, to [[women]] and [[children]] - the most vulnerable people.	Female,Female,Female,Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
3065	Mr [[President]], [[I]] am sorry, but the motion for a resolution on Venezuela tabled mainly by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is a practical joke cobbled together in order to exploit the urgency debate for political purposes and to try to discredit Mr [[Chávez]].	Male,Amb,Male
3066	[[I]] support the [[Members]] who took the floor to highlight the importance of the directive on the posting of [[workers]] and on the services of general interest.	Amb,Amb,Amb
3067	[[I]] support the provision that the EU should freeze the visa ban for an extended list of Belarus [[officials]] but, at the same time, unlock contacts and travel within the EU for ordinary [[Belarusians]] as much as possible.	Amb,Amb,Amb
3068	[[rapporteur]]. - Madam [[President]], I agree with Mr [[Deva]] that [[we]] gave up certain of our rights.	Amb,Female,Male,Amb
3069	Through the collection of cord blood at birth, which, in the past, used to be discarded with the placenta, [[we]] can obtain a significant source of undifferentiated stem cells without causing discomfort to the [[mother]] or [[child]], and these can be modulated and used successfully at any time in the future to treat leukaemia and at least 70 other conditions.	Amb,Female,Amb
3070	It was felt that EUR 500 was too much per month, and it was decided to cut this by EUR 15, despite the fact that more than 13% of female Portuguese [[workers]] receive only this amount, compared with 6% of male [[workers]].	Female,Male
3071	According to statistics, [[women farmers]] in the European Union account for 43% of farm [[labourers]] and 20% of farm [[managers]], and this does not include the [[spouses]] of male [[farmers]] whose work is often not taken into account.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Male
3072	Qualified female [[farmers]] need broadly-based training and must be able to operate and think in an entrepreneurial way.	Female
3073	[[We]] have been informed of the statement that was made in the House of Commons yesterday, and the Minister for Agriculture, Mr [[Hogg]], also faxed his statement through to [[me]].	Amb,Male,Amb
3074	The British [[experts]] have reported to various [[committees]], including in particular the Standing Veterinary Committee.	Amb,Amb
3075	After all, [[I]] don't suppose that there is [[anyone]] here who believes that the [[Lapps]] in Sweden, for example, have stopped hunting because [[fox]] traps are prohibited.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3076	In addition, [[I]] believe that the implementation timetable in our proposal strikes a good compromise between the immediate future and the time that [[undertakings]] actually need to adjust to the new equipment.	Amb,Amb
3077	But [[I]] am sure that the [[Member]] will get a response from the [[Minister]] for Justice, to whom she has written.	Amb,Female,Amb
3078	[[We]] believe that it is important for a signal to be given in the budget as well, to indicate that, where human rights are increasingly under threat, as Mr [[van den Broek]] said yesterday, the [[Community]] will not be seen to be financing projects other than those that promote democracy, human rights and civil society.	Amb,Male,Amb
3079	[[Those]] who called for flexibility should remember that each unemployed [[person]] has shown 100 % flexibility on his own part.	Amb,Male
3080	Even so, [[I]] believe [[we]] are moving in the right direction, and I have no doubt that the work done by our rapporteur, Mrs [[Fontaine]], will help us on our way.	Amb,Amb,Female
3081	[[I]] now invite the Commissioner, Mrs [[Wulf-Mathies]], to speak so that [[we]] are then in a better position to vote.	Amb,Female,Amb
3082	[[I]] would like to state quite categorically on behalf of the Scottish National Party members here, Mrs [[Ewing]] and myself, that is not the case.	Amb,Female
3083	However, as Mrs [[Palacio Vallelersundi]] will no doubt explain later in greater detail, this does not preclude [[Parliament]] maintaining the position set out in its resolution of November 1996 that the legal basis for the conclusion of the fisheries agreement between the European Union and Mauritania requires Parliament's assent, pursuant to article 43.	Female,Amb
3084	In order to ensure continuity in the representation of the euro and in view of the rotating presidencies, a [[minister]] from a G7 Member State will support the [[President]] of the Euro 11.	Amb,Amb
3085	Consequently, [[I]] should like to thank the [[Commissioner]] for his written reply about another matter, which I received this morning.	Amb,Male
3086	Secondly, the satisfactory result would not have been possible without the immense work by Mr [[White]].	Male
3087	Mr [[President]], on behalf of my [[group]], [[I]] should like to thank the [[rapporteur]] who has produced an excellent piece of work.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
3088	[[I]] am not and never have been a [[lover]] of war and possess nothing of a warmonger in me.	Amb,Amb
3089	Mr [[President]], Mr [[President-in-Office]] of the Council, Mr [[Commissioner]], in recent years, Europe has been plunged into two significant health crises caused by food; firstly, BSE in the United Kingdom and, subsequently, the dioxin case in Belgium.	Male,Male,Male
3090	[[Madam President]], [[I]] agree with what my [[colleague]] has just said in thanking the [[workers]] and in expressing her appreciation for what has been done since July to improve the situation, and for the on-going building work aimed at further improvements.	Female,Amb,Female,Amb
3091	The [[Commissioner]] already made this quite clear at his hearing in the European Parliament, and it is a principle that must be observed.	Male
3092	Of course, the issues mentioned by Mr [[Ferber]] were discussed; [[we]] simply reached a different conclusion.	Male,Amb

3176	As [[chair]] of the US [[delegation]] here in this Parliament, I am only too well aware of the many slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that make up the trade disputes between the EU and the United States of America.	Amb,Amb
3177	A hundred and twenty-five million [[children]], mainly [[girls]], do not receive any education.	Female,Female
3178	[[They]] have had their little pleasures, Mr [[President]].	Amb,Male
3179	A young [[person]] who is not recognised as an individual with his own experiences and his own knowledge is a rejected human being.	Male
3180	Furthermore, [[we]] believe that this deficiency in the legislation may be exacerbating a very serious phenomenon, that is, the rejection by young [[people]] of motherhood.	Amb,Female
3181	The pregnant [[worker]] must be provided with adequate protection, which is designed for their specific circumstances, but this should not mean discrimination or a reduction in their work opportunities, but quite the opposite.	Female
3182	[[I]] would particularly like to thank the [[Minister]] for the work she is doing in her own country and as President-in-Office of the Council, and I would like to make a connection between the work of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the work of the [[Commission]], focusing on one point: employment.	Amb,Female,Amb
3183	[[Whoever]] undertakes a free initiative creates at least one job - his own - and often employs [[family]] members and other [[people]] as well.	Male,Amb,Amb
3184	General [[White]], an Englishman, of the future European rapid reaction force, meets [[Captain Rossi]], an Italian.	Male,Amb
3185	As the [[rapporteur]] on that proposal, which failed to reassure me, I believed I was doing the right thing, this time, in waiting for another ruling by the [[Court]] of Justice in a similar case, the Marshall case. This ruling was issued in November 1997 and, this time, was not in favour of Mr Marshall, who felt that he was being discriminated against when a positive action was taken in favour of a female [[colleague]].	Amb,Amb,Female
3186	[[I]] believe that the European Parliament should currently be sensitive to the fact, condemned by certain NGOs, that four [[Palestinians]] may be executed if [[Yasser Arafat]] does not commute the sentences handed down for internal activities within the Palestinian area or for collaboration.	Amb,Amb,Amb
3187	Madam [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] wish to thank Mr [[Olsson]] for his good and critical report, which does a thorough job of highlighting some difficult points.	Female,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Male
3188	[[I]] would also like to say on behalf of the international [[community]] that we welcome the condemnation by the Palestinian [[leadership]] and by President [[Arafat]] himself of the [[terrorist]] acts.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
3189	That also applies to the decision-making process and at all costs [[we]] want to preserve the phenomenon that the Governing Council's decisions are decisions by a collegiate body and that every individual [[member]] of that body will defend and describe the outcome of certain discussions as if he had been 100% enthusiastic about those decisions.

3190	B5-0601/2002 by Mrs [[Maij-Weggen]] and [[others]], on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in Sudan;	Female,Amb
3191	If some far-sighted [[person]] fifteen years ago had written out the agenda for this European Council, as it now is, complete with the reunification of Europe, he would have been thought to be deluded!	Male
3192	[[I]] would like to ask the [[Commissioner]] whether he agrees with the [[President]] of the United States of America that perhaps Europe's position on trade in genetically modified crops is having an effect on our trade with the southern African countries in agricultural products, thereby affecting their ability to feed themselves?	Amb,Male,Amb
3193	. (ES) Madam [[President]], Mrs [[Ghilardotti]] has already referred to the importance of this issue, to its complexity, to the experiments that have already been conducted in countries such as Australia and South Africa and to the experiments that [[we]] have also started in the Union.

3200	The benefits of regional integration, market access and integrated trade and development, as my colleague Mrs [[Martens]] said, are absolutely clear.	Female
3201	For this reason [[I]] support the adoption of this compromise solution, particularly as it is the Day of the [[Child]] in Poland today, and this is the present that our children most deserve.	Amb,Amb
3202	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[I]] would like to extend my [[group's]] thanks to the rapporteurs, Mrs [[Kovács]] and Mrs [[Gál]], and I do not do so as a formality, but because both rapporteurs have had a very laborious task to perform and have set out, on this [[House's]] behalf, a strong and convincing position, one that is backed by a large majority and will, it is to be hoped, also impress the [[Council]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Female,Amb,Amb
3203	[[I]] just want to reiterate something to which Mrs [[Berès]] has referred, namely that [[we]], in the Szejna report, forcefully put forward the view that market forces should, in the first instance, be allowed free rein, so that we could see how this directive proved itself in practice, and that we would decide whether further steps were needed when the [[Commission]], in 2011/2012, had brought out the first report.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
3204	Let [[me]] assure [[you]] first of all that I will of course brief and inform my [[colleague]].	Amb,Amb,Amb

3210	[[author]]. - (FI) Mr [[President]], I would like to make a final comment on the debate [[we]] have just had and say that, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, I recently sent a letter to the Conference of Committee [[Chairs]], asking it to consider bringing these discussions forward, so that Parliament may be fully attended and also so that the Council can have a more prominent role here in the discussion.	Male,Male,Amb,Amb
3211	(ES) Mr [[President]], a Spanish Central Criminal Court [[judge]] has confirmed what many of [[us]] were already aware of, namely that [[Hugo Chávez]], the President of Venezuela, cooperates with ETA and FARC [[terrorists]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3212	It is worth reminding [[everyone]] of the tragic situation of the [[herring]] population in the Western Baltic.	Amb,Amb
3213	Mr [[Wathelet]] is a little sad; he has the impression that too little has been done.	Male
3214	Christianity has played a very important part in our discussions today but many honourable [[Members]] have pointed out that this also needs to apply in ensuring that [[we]] have respect and tolerance for other faiths in everything that we do.	Amb,Amb
3215	(HU) Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], nuclear safety has a human face.	Male,Amb,Female,Male
3216	Mrs [[Harms]], you have made sweeping statements referring to the old [[boys']] network and suggested that the national nuclear regulatory [[bodies]] are not fulfilling their statutory tasks. [[I]] believe that this is a serious accusation which implies a lack of trust in your fellow Member Mr [[Trittin]] who, as German Federal Environment Minister, was responsible for this regulatory body in Germany for seven years.	Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Male
3217	Let [[me]] ask [[you]] how the individual [[citizen]] in Europe can check where his data is stored in Europe and what data is stored and what means of influence he has to protect his privacy in this connection.	Amb,Amb,Male
3218	In any case a political dialogue must be established as soon as possible with all the Algerian [[authorities]] and democratic [[powers]], to find a solution to the current crisis and, hence, restore as quickly as possible the civil peace needed for the forthcoming legislative elections.	Amb,Amb
3219	Indeed, the [[author]] of the report herself refers to the need to involve the [[consumer]] at every stage of the process.	Female,Amb
3220	And as Mrs [[Green]] has already pointed out, these are obstacles of which the [[Turks]] themselves are increasingly aware.	Female,Amb
3221	A female secret service [[agent]] was quartered because she denounced [[government]] attacks on the [[press]].	Female,Amb,Amb
3222	[[Inspectors]] have a link there, either an [[employee]] relationship or a fee relationship, so that they depend on the slaughterhouses.	Amb,Amb
3223	The Danish Social [[Democrats]] support this idea and see this proposal in particular as something which could make the coins more recognizable and so benefit the [[blind]] and [[elderly]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
3224	It appears, for instance, that the European [[citizen]] feels less optimistic about biotechnology, whilst his knowledge of modern biotechnology has in fact increased.	Male
3225	Mr [[President]], with respect for your management of proceedings, Mr [[Provan]] has described quite clearly exactly what happened during the vote on Recital A. [[You]] called for the vote on Recital A, and the first calls of "check' were heard immediately afterwards.	Male,Male,Amb
3226	Mr [[President]], on behalf of the Socialist Group, [[I]] want to congratulate my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, Mrs [[Langenhagan]], Mr [[Kindermann]] and Mr [[Kofoed]], on their excellent reports which have a common underlying theme, namely sustainable fishing in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Male
3227	[[We]] do not have confidence in what the [[Minister]] is going to do because, since the beginning of the process, she has mistaken her role and is more involved in making declarations than participating in negotiations, as she should.	Amb,Female
3228	[[I]] would like to end with the remark, as his [[mother]] declared with great dignity at his funeral, that while [[Matub]] may no longer be with [[us]] in person, his songs and poems will remain deep in our hearts for ever and his struggle for peace will continue.	Amb,Female,Male,Amb

3313	With regard to the [[Commissioner]], who has also referred to this humble [[Member]] of Parliament and who has said that he has heard no argument to convince him of the need for two regulations, [[I]] would like to say to [[MrPatten]] who is a good friend of mine that I believe that he has not properly understood the position here.

3316	Credit where credit is due, [[Commissioner]] – and [[I]] say that also on behalf of our [[group]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
3317	The main problem with this proposal is that of striking a balance between, on the one hand, the need to improve [[victim]] protection cover – cover for personal and material damage – in the event of a car accident involving a car of relatively low value and the fact, on the other hand, that improvement in cover of this nature will result in a rise in insurance premiums, when the ‘prices’ charged by [[insurers]] are not monitored.

3325	[[I]] agree totally with Mr [[Wiersma]] and I too regret that the EU Member States have not been treated fairly and equally when it comes to the matter of visas.	Amb,Male
3326	Directive 2004/81/EC follows that line by providing for the granting of a reflection period allowing the [[victim]] to recover and escape the influence of [[traffickers]], and granting a residence permit.	Amb,Amb
3327	[[We]] shall take into account the views which have been expressed and the suggestions which have been made - not to France, Mr [[Van Orden]], but to the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, since France itself has no power as France, but merely holds the mandate which has been given to it in this context by the European Union - including your proposal that the Council should call for an extraordinary session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, providing, of course, that it is possible to do so.	Amb,Male
3328	In Europe [[we]] have the Solidarity Fund that should be made available to the Northern Ireland Executive by the Commission, and [[I]] would ask [[you]] to write to the [[head]] of the Commission, to contact the Office of the [[First Minister]] in Northern Ireland to see how best it can help.

3333	[[I]] do not believe that Mr [[Barroso's]] pledge to fight social dumping in Europe is far-reaching enough, and it is for this reason, as well as the abovementioned, that I took the decision to abstain on this vote.	Amb,Male
3334	Subject: [[Women's]] participation in positions of responsibility in the job market	Female
3335	It is a challenge to draw together the different [[players]] in the field of external relations, and the overall aim has to be to achieve a diplomatic synergy.	Amb
3336	This bill's provisions are draconian and among them, let [[me]] inform the [[House]], are: any [[person]] alleged to be homosexual would be at risk of life imprisonment or in some circumstances the death penalty; any [[parent]] who does not denounce their lesbian [[daughter]] or gay [[son]] to the [[authorities]] would face fines and probably three years in prison; any [[teacher]] who does not report a lesbian or gay [[pupil]] to the authorities within 24 hours would face the same penalties; any [[landlord]] or [[landlady]] who happens to give housing to a 'suspected' [[homosexual]] would risk seven years of imprisonment.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
3337	(IT) [[Madam President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], in line with the comments made by some of my fellow [[Members]], [[I]] believe that the democratisation process in Turkey is an essential journey that will enable that country to move closer to the European Union and that our coexistence within the European Union must be based on inalienable principles and values, and that their recognition is a prerequisite for the entry of any state.	Female,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
3338	Mr [[President]], naturally, [[I]] would like to thank Mrs [[in 't Veld]] on behalf of my colleague and friend, Mr [[Almunia]], for her report on competition policy 2008.	Male,Amb,Female,Male
3339	[[She]] is in a prison with more than 20 female [[inmates]] whom she convicted over the years for very severe crimes.	Female,Female
3340	Madam [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]] - the few of you who are still here, for weeks, [[we]] have been discussing a paper from Chancellor [[Merkel]] and President [[Sarkozy]] that, apparently, never existed.	Female,Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
3341	The debt burden for every [[man]], [[woman]] and [[child]] in Ireland is roughly EUR 160 000 just to bail out the banks, and that is not including the interest.	Male,Female,Amb
3342	In Greece, investments in renewable energy are one of the few counterweights to the economic crisis and the commitment by the outgoing [[Minister]] for Environmental Affairs to safeguard guaranteed prices needs to be renewed immediately by her [[successor]].	Female,Amb
3343	As the elected [[representative]] of a maritime region in the west of France, I can assure the [[House]] that [[they]] are expecting [[us]] to send them a message of hope, telling them that the profession they have chosen is not doomed, that it may be suffering a crisis, but that they can trust in its future and that their [[children]] will be able to practise it.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3344	As the honourable [[Member]] states in her question, Article 105a of the Treaty, which does not apply to Member States not participating in economic and monetary union, assigns to the European Central Bank the exclusive right to authorize the issue of banknotes within the Community.	Female
3345	[[I]] therefore ask that the [[author]] of these remarks and these actions apologise or withdraw her remarks.	Amb,Female
3346	The honourable [[Member]] will understand that [[I]] cannot give her a straightforward answer in relation to part of her question since the rules which apply to the transport of fissile materials are, as I have just pointed out, the concern of the International Civil Aviation Organization, a body not linked to the European Union and to which Member States accede on an individual basis.	Female,Amb
3347	It has been transformed internally within the [[Commission]] into a Joint Instruction signed by the [[Directors-General]] of all external DGs and the [[Director]] of ECHO and sent to all external services and [[delegations]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3348	[[I]] would point out to the leader of the socialist and social democratic [[group]], Mrs [[Green]], that all [[governments]] are now going to have to continue working on the tasks [[we]] set ourselves at Amsterdam.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
3349	[[We]] have voted against Mr [[Rothley's]] report as it represents a fundamental position which we do not share.	Amb,Male
3350	Mrs [[van Dijk]] has mentioned the staging points.	Female
3351	In fact, the ECSC coffers contain ECU 1.2 billion which will basically be enough to finance the operating budgets until 2002, when the Treaty expires, and to pay for the last [[pensioner]] until 2026.	Amb
3352	[[I]] give the floor to Mr [[Monti]] to answer Mr [[Wibe's]] question.	Amb,Male,Male
3353	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], as a [[co-signatory]] of the motion of censure I of course voted for it and I believe that the large number of [[Members]] who supported the motion - about 40 % - makes it clear that the [[Commission]] no longer has the support of a broad [[majority]].	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3354	[[I]] am pleased that the Commissioner responsible, Mr [[Marín]], is here this afternoon, and it is only fair that [[we]] recognise that, faced with the devastating effects of the hurricane, the European Commission has reacted quickly and effectively. We hope that it will soon be able to propose a rehabilitation plan for the region in accordance with the Commissioner's statement.	Amb,Male,Amb
3355	In particular, Mr [[Virgin]], on behalf of the [[committee]], considers that the new Annex C proposed by the [[Council]] should be deleted, as the ban on exports of the types of waste listed are already covered by lists of waste in the Basle Convention, and yet another list further complicates what is already very complex legislation.	Male,Amb,Amb
3356	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], following the [[Kalanke]] ruling - concerning the [[gentleman]] from Bremen whom the European Court of Justice ruled on 17 October 1995 to have fallen victim to discrimination because his female [[colleague]] had been promoted rather than himself, based on the state law on equality in the Land Bremen - the [[Commission]] submitted on 17 March 1996 a proposal to amend the 1976 directive.	Male,Amb,Amb,Male,Female,Amb
3357	The next item is the report (A4-0070/99) by Mr [[Corbett]], Mr [[Gutiérrez Díaz]] and Mrs [[Palacio Vallelersundi]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on the amendments to be made to the Rules of Procedure.	Male,Male,Female,Amb
3358	In my country there are hardly any male [[teachers]] in primary schools and hardly any male [[magistrates]] left.	Male,Male
3359	In my opinion he is a really first-rate [[Commissioner]] with whom it has always been a pleasure to work in an atmosphere of warmth and great personal trust.	Male
3360	The European Union has condemned the many violations of human rights that have occurred in Afghanistan, especially the continual and systematic discrimination towards [[women]] and girl [[children]], executions carried out without trial and a system based on harsh discipline and tyranny.

3371	She is a big [[fan]] of [[Captain Man]].	Female,Male
3372	[[Each]] benefited from the [[other]], and their relationship went beyond that of [[author]] and [[publisher]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3373	She's a [[musician]], she's a writer, she's someone that is not afraid to try ideas in the studio, not afraid to get vulnerable in front of [[people]], not scared to go for the high note when she doesn't know if she can hit it or not.	Female,Amb
3374	[[Knowles]] attends events offered to the [[press]], paid for by the movie studios, including visits to movie sets and premieres.	Amb,Amb
3375	With the opening words "To you, young Germany, [[I]] dedicate these speeches" [[he]] helped to create the expression "Young Germany".	Male,Male
3376	Being led from one mystery of creation to the next, it is explained that the [[seeker]] continues to be astonished by the works of [[God]].	Amb,Male
3377	Before unveiling a plaque, [[she]] said "Let [[us]] not forget that even one book, one pen, one [[teacher]] can change the world".	Female,Amb,Amb
3378	As a [[journalist]], [[he]] has had bylines in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Detroit News, Seattle Post, Entertainment Weekly, Golfweek, Golf and Travel & Golf.	Male,Male
3379	In Stealing First, [[Courtney]] bets that she can get [[him]] to kiss [[Ginger]] on the chair lift on the school ski trip, to which [[Miranda]] says is impossible.	Female,Male,Amb,Amb
3380	From that point on, [[Smith]] began a long search for a religion that would teach her the way of salvation.	Female
3381	From 2011 until 2017, [[he]] was [[Director]] of the Hausdorff Research Institute for Mathematics (HIM) in Bonn.	Male,Male
3382	As a [[teacher]] both in the classroom and in the field he was eminently successful.	Male
3383	It was built as a headquarters for the Kohler Women's Club, the local chapter of Girl [[Scouts]] and as a public meeting place for lectures and small performances.	Female
3384	34 Then [[he]] went up and lay on the [[child]], putting his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands.	Male,Male
3385	A social system can define and/or prescribe something as meaningful – however, experiencing it as something meaningful is an intrinsic process of that [[person]] (first person perspective).	Amb
3386	She is an exceptional [[artist]], this much is certain.	Female
3387	The Haverhill store in which he worked closed during the Panic of 1837, and [[Page]] began a career in banking as Cashier of the Grafton Bank.	Male
3388	1886 a new school was built, which had to be enlarged in 1905 due to increased [[student]] enrollment.	Amb
3389	The [[princesses]] were not allowed to mix with [[anyone]] outside of the Royal [[Court]], and rarely came into contact with [[men]] other than pages, [[equerries]], or [[attendants]].	Female,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
3390	Before, [[he]] was founding [[Director]] of the ‘Centre for Higher Education Internationalisation’ (CHEI) at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan, Italy, and Professor of Internationalization of Higher Education at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.	Male,Male
3391	As a political [[companion]] and friend of [[Vytautas Landsbergis]], the first head of state of Lithuania after its declaration of independence from the Soviet Union, [[he]] wrote the biography of Landsbergis in 1990-1991, including the history of independence of Lithuania in the book „Laisvės Byla“ (File of Freedom). www.rasytojai.lt www.thefreelibrary.com www.juozasglinskis.com	Male,Amb,Male
3392	[[He]] has been a [[member]] of the choir NDR Chor since 2001.	Male,Male
3393	Movement and other actions are handled in real time during Action Mode, though limited in movement by an action point (AP) gauge that varies for each type of [[character]].	Amb
3394	[[He]] is now a [[member]] of the [[Committee]] on Digital Management, Data Protection and Freedom of Information, as well as in the Subcommittee on Investment Management and Controlling.	Male,Male,Amb
3395	There are many [[beetles]] including ground beetles such as [[Amara Erratica]], and hundreds of species of [[butterfly]].	Amb,Amb,Amb

3398	There were four [[households]].	Amb

3400	The next level includes most of the principal reception rooms, including the Great Hall, the [[Ladies']] Drawing Room and the [[Gentlemen's]] Study.	Female,Male
3401	The Council consists of 29 members including the [[Chancellor]], [[Pro-chancellors]], [[Vice-chancellor]], [[Treasurer]], [[Pro-vice-chancellors]], [[staff]] and [[student]] members, city council representation and a majority of lay members.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb

3405	Program offices within the Office of the [[Director]] fund research through the institutes: "Who We Are".	Amb
3406	The [[candidate]] will go one round if he receives at least one of the four [[jury]] votes.	Male,Amb
3407	Although the [[police]], at the behest of [[Annegret's mother]], an acquaintance of her daughter and a potential whistleblower, interviewed [[Reinstrom]], but due to the fact that he knew the interviewing police [[officer]] from a swimming club they attended, he persuaded the man that he knew nothing and further investigations were omitted.	Amb,Female,Male,Male
3408	"On forty years: Remarks from the [[editor]]".	Amb
3409	In the period leading up to World War I, [[Singer]] published several monographs, for which he was awarded the D.Litt. degree by Oxford.	Male
3410	While still a [[student]] at the Munich Luisengymnasium, [[Max Reinhardt]] engaged her to appear on the stage of the Deutsches Theater in Berlin for the first time.	Female,Amb
3411	A senior [[officer]] in the [[team]] then noticed the train and yelled "train is coming!	Amb,Amb
3412	The [[character]] quotes the Old Testament more often than the New Testament.	Amb
3413	A few [[families]] were able to escape through temporary escape, including the [[Singer]] family.	Amb,Amb
3414	An old college friend of [[Crowley's]], 33-year-old [[Laurence Luckinbill]], agreed to play [[Hank]] despite warnings from his [[agent]] that it would end his career, even though the agent was herself a lesbian.	Male,Female,Male,Female
3415	United Abominations was the [[band's]] first album to feature [[Glen Drover]], [[Shawn Drover]], and [[James Lomenzo]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3416	His portrayal of a gay [[nurse]] forced to take care of [[Roy Cohn]] as he dies of AIDS won him the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play.	Male,Male
3417	At the Royal Rumble in January 1989, [[Bravo]], accompanied by [[Martin]], teamed with The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers [[(Jacques]] and [[Raymond]]) but lost a two out of three falls match against [[Jim Duggan]] and The Hart Foundation ([[Bret]] Hart and Jim Neidhart).	Amb,Amb,Male,Male,Amb,Amb
3418	The [[members]], with few exceptions, were mostly war veterans, 40 years old, men, and professional artists.	Male
3419	She is a retired university [[lecturer]].	Female
3420	[[They]] and his [[followers]] are hanged.	Male,Amb
3421	The prison [[director]] has distributed the [[prisoners']] numbers into the drawers in the following fashion: The prisoners now act as follows: Prisoner 1 first opens drawer 1 and finds number 7.	Amb,Amb
3422	Two days after the decision to proceed with the operation was taken by the Allied [[commanders]], the US 6th Army's Alamo [[Scouts]] began to deploy in the area of Cape Gloucester.	Amb,Amb

3426	She is considered an [[expert]] on international security.	Female
3427	From 1949 until her retirement in 1966, [[she]] was a [[judge]] for the Østre Landsret, one of Denmark's two high courts.	Female,Female

3430	[[Midkiff]] found [[her]] unfaithful, however, and he returned the [[teenager]] to her [[father]] after the two had been together for only six weeks.	Male,Female,Female,Male
3431	In 2014, [[he]] was voted the Best Male [[Host]] of the year at the Swedish Radio Awards.	Male,Male
3432	Since various comments have been made, [[I]] would like to specify that although the [[Minister]] is not present, the [[Council]] is represented by senior civil [[servants]], who will of course pass our words on to him.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
3433	Mr [[President]], that is the approach [[I]] would go for; once again, although I reject the medicine prescribed by Mr [[Garot]], I have the greatest admiration for all the trouble he has taken to explore the possibility of introducing more social support into the [[pig]] farming sector.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb
3434	[[We]] knew where we stood with [[Konrad Adenauer]], with [[François Mitterand]] and even with [[Helmut Kohl]] when it came to Europe.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3435	Before [[I]] set out the position that the [[Commission]] intends to adopt on the occasion of this second reading, I hope [[you]] will permit me to refer back to the amendments adopted by [[Parliament]] at first reading, since your [[rapporteur]] has mentioned them.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3436	At the same time [[I]] should like to support emphatically what Mr [[Poettering]] and Mrs [[Maes]] have just said.	Amb,Male,Female
3437	As you know, Madam [[Minister]], Catalonia is more than just a region.	Female
3438	It was therefore with extreme annoyance that [[I]] took part in this brief vote on the [[Miller]] report.	Amb,Amb
3439	The first is in relation to Mr [[Stevenson's]] attack on a Belgian [[minister]] who is not here to defend herself.	Male,Female
3440	[[I]] am confident that Mrs [[Banotti]] will handle this.	Amb,Female
3441	Like any [[politician]], [[Sharon]] obviously wishes to be re-elected, and the prospect of re-election would fade from sight if [[Israelis]] were exposed to economic sanctions because of the way in which he governs.	Amb,Male,Amb
3442	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], President [[Mugabe's]] dictatorship is reprehensible.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb
3443	In these countries, any opposition [[activist]], critical [[journalist]] or simply any [[Muslim]] practising his belief, risks ending up in a torture chamber, a penal colony or on death row on charges of terrorism, religious extremism or an attempt on the life of the [[President]].	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
3444	There is just one sport of which [[I]] am not a [[fan]], and that is [[women's]] boxing.	Amb,Amb,Female
3445	The [[dictator]], who will stop at nothing, attempted to suppress this cry for help with the now routine arrest of the opposition [[leader]].	Amb,Amb
3446	[[We]] are asked to believe that what our [[citizens]] really want is an EU with a legal personality, a legally binding Charter of Fundamental Rights, the removal of the pillar structure, an extension of majority voting, an EU [[president]] and foreign [[minister]], common asylum and immigration policies and a European public [[prosecutor]] - in short, that [[people]] want a fundamental change in the relationship between the Union and its people.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3447	As Commissioner [[Monti]] has said, [[we]] are not talking about a supermarket [[one]] cannot go into a supermarket to buy the services of a [[doctor]] but, within a market context, [[clients]] also have the right to benefit from the possibility, for example, of competition within a sector in which there are more [[professionals]] than there is demand for them.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3448	The [[rapporteur]] says there is no immediate prospect of therapies being available to [[patients]]; if he gets this restrictive deadline reinstated, he may be right.	Male,Amb
3449	[[People’s]] questions to [[me]] betray their concern; this very morning, a renowned European [[journalist]] asked me whether the euro would still be there in ten years’ time.	Amb,Amb,Amb
3450	[[I]] believe Mr [[Barroso]] will honour the promise he made today before this House, namely that he will change the make-up of his [[Commission]] during his term of office, if the situation so requires.	Amb,Male,Amb
3451	In many cases, it will be for the [[Vice-President]] of the Commission and her public relations work to deal with that, but the Commission as a whole, along with [[Parliament]], must work at resolving this contradiction.	Female,Amb
3452	Mr President, Mr [[Hans-Peter Martin]], a non-attached Member of this House, is now, in the Austrian media, delivering himself of sweeping, foul, unqualified insinuations and slurs, aimed no longer only at this House and the European Union’s institutions, but also at [[those]] who assist us in our work as Members and the [[officials]] of the European Parliament.	Male,Amb,Amb
3453	Personally, [[I]] voted for the best [[candidate]] in our constituency, and that candidate happened to be a woman.	Amb,Female
3454	[[I]] was not surprised but encouraged during the last Question Time when a [[colleague]] spoke of lifelong learning as a right of [[citizens]], a right of an [[individual]] vis-à-vis the State or its [[authorities]] to have access to lifelong learning, not just to basic or secondary education.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3455	. As [[representative]] of the opinion of the [[Committee]] on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I would like to point out that the report presented is more balanced than documents on a similar theme which have been debated previously.	Amb,Amb
3456	A majority of the [[farmers]] in the world are women!	Female
3457	In the Water Framework Directive, successfully adopted in 2000 due to the fact that Mrs [[Lienemann]] was the rapporteur, 'good environmental status' is called for by 2015, that is to say, 15 years after the adoption of the directive.	Female
3458	[[I]] have just heard that Mr [[Cohn-Bendit]] has also been re-elected, and I assume that Mrs [[Frassoni]] has been as well, so warm congratulations to them too.	Amb,Male,Female
3459	The previous [[speaker]] was right, of course, when she stated that in a sense this is an exceptional agreement because of the scale and importance of the flights concerned.	Female
3460	These arrangements will be very different in many cases from conventional buying contracts, although, as [[I]] indicated in my response to Mrs [[McCarthy's]] report, there is increasing interest in more transparent conditions for these types of contracts.	Amb,Female
3461	These 27 Member States have two million [[soldiers]], 10 000 tanks and 3 000 fighter aircraft.	Amb
3462	Thank you very much indeed, [[Commissioner]], for an interesting debate, in which more than 50% of the [[speakers]] were women, which is just as it should be.	Amb,Female
3463	This should be done in cooperation with the social [[partners]], and the latter must also ensure that [[women]] are sufficiently represented in their organisations.	Amb,Female
3464	[[I]] would like to thank Mrs [[Trautmann]], Mrs [[Hall]] and Mrs [[Korhola]] for the work carried out.	Amb,Female,Female,Female
3465	(FI) Mr [[President]], Mr [[Minister]], last week in Ljubljana it came to my attention that the Slovenian [[parliament]] had ratified the Treaty without a consolidated version, which astonished [[me]].	Male,Male,Amb,Amb
3466	In order to overcome the obstacles to the reintegration of female [[prisoners]] into [[society]] and the job market, [[we]] must obviously again stress the need to combine implementing measures and an adapted safety net.	Female,Amb,Amb
3467	in writing. - (FI) Madam [[President]], the first challenge in this proposed legislation before [[us]] lies in the fact that it is our first attempt to establish Community-wide norms in immigration policy.	Female,Amb
3468	Every crime perpetrated by a [[teenager]] is the result of an educational failure by [[adults]].	Amb,Amb
3469	For an organization that seeks to erode the differences between [[nations]] and [[peoples]], the EU attaches a great deal of importance to linguistic nationalism.	Amb,Amb
3470	The shadow [[rapporteurs]] and the [[rapporteur]] herself have put in a great deal of effort to reach this compromise, a compromise that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European [[Democrats]], too, would be able to support.	Amb,Female,Amb
3471	She has proven herself as a key [[person]] working on this issue in this House.	Female
3472	[[Member]] of the [[Commission]]. - Mr [[President]], I am pleased that you have devoted your time to this important debate.	Amb,Amb,Male
3473	[[I]] absolutely agree with Mr [[Leinen]] that the Lisbon Treaty brought in enormous changes.	Amb,Male
3474	Since [[they]] more often work part-time than [[men]], because they carry out what can be casual work in the tertiary sector, because they have fragmented careers, because, even today, they are less well paid than men for the same kinds of jobs, and because their pensions are lower as a result, [[we]] need to make sure that [[women]] are constantly the focus of our attention.	Female,Male,Amb,Female
3475	In future [[we]] must certainly ensure that all the Community's institutions, and especially our own, refrain from any activity on 9 May so that its [[Members]] can be present at the major annual events uniting Europe and its [[citizens]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
3476	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], as [[I]] listened to the strong words spoken by Mr [[Santer]] yesterday and Mr [[Fischler]] today condemning the behaviour of the British [[Government]], I could not help feeling that this tough talking is really only a facade behind which there lurks a strategy or tactics that will make it easier to give in to demands for an end to the embargo.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Male,Male,Amb
3477	Mr [[President]], [[I]] do not like to speak in the European Parliament on domestic policy issues, but since a Spanish socialist [[Member]] has made some personal remarks about a Spanish [[minister]], I think I have a duty to explain the problem to her.	Male,Amb,Female,Female
3478	Madam [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], on behalf of my [[group I]] should like to congratulate Mrs [[Fouque]] on her splendid report on the follow-up to the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development, the first assessment of which is to be made in Hanover in 1999.	Female,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Female
3479	Madam [[Commissioner]], [[I]] wanted to ask you a supplementary question.	Female,Amb
3480	The [[rapporteur]] rightly raises, in his proposal, the problem of defining rural areas.	Male
3481	[[I]] was told that this Burmese refugee [[child]] was so sick that it was visible to the naked eye that she would be unable to survive repatriation, but the return went ahead and four days later the child was reported dead.	Amb,Female
3482	[[I]] am tempted in this context to give the same reply as the apocryphal doctoral [[student]] who, when asked to explain his thesis, said: ' It is self-evident' , but I shall not succumb entirely.	Amb,Male
3483	And it has the additional audacity - as Mr [[Virgin]] pointed out earlier - to include the following statement in Recital 5 of its text: ' it is possible that countries which have replied that they do not wish to receive some or all types of waste listed in Annex II of the Regulation may not be fully aware of the significance of their response for their industrial sector.'	Male
3484	Mr [[Smith]], [[I]] shall most willingly give the floor to Ms [[McKenna]], in application of Rule 108.	Male,Amb,Female
3485	Mr [[President]], [[I]] rise to support Mr [[Cornelissen]], Mrs [[Ewing]] and Mr [[Miller]].	Male,Amb,Male,Female,Male
3486	The next item is the report (A4-0328/98) by Mr [[Paasilinna]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the communication from the [[Commission]]: Green Paper on the convergence of the telecommunications, media and information technology sectors and the implications for regulation (COM(97)0623 - C4-0664/97).	Male,Amb,Amb

3598	It is in that firm belief that, as mentioned by Mr [[Bloch von Blottnitz]], the [[Greens]] are prepared to support the amendments to the Commission text tabled by Mr [[Pimenta]]: Amendments Nos 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 28 in particular remedy the unacceptable loopholes which the Commission proposal to amend Regulation No 3254/91 would allow for the purpose of continuing to bring into the European Union pelts obtained using traps.

3611	Obviously this concept must be rejected but, clearly, Europe must take great pains not to appear always to be rapping [[others]] over the knuckles, as a [[schoolmaster]] does to a [[pupil]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
3612	The [[Chair]] has taken this decision owing to the special circumstances that have arisen in this debate.	Amb
3613	Furthermore, [[I]] agree with Mr [[Olsson]] that [[we]] ought really to be far more innovative in agriculture policy.	Amb,Male,Amb
3614	An important element in ensuring that this happens, as has already been said by Mr [[Smith]] in proposing the resolution, is the role of both the [[Council]] and the [[Commission]].	Male,Amb,Amb

3616	In the high middle ages, one of the main instruments that was used to promote economic development throughout Europe and to overcome the problems connected with private money was the introduction of silver coinage, guaranteed by the [[monarch]].	Amb

Amb,Female
3705	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would also like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs [[Attwooll]], for the spirit of consensus she has created in our [[committee]] in order to arrive at compromise amendments, particularly with Mrs [[Fraga Estevez]] and to substantially improve, as has been said, the [[Commission' s]] proposal on a key issue, which [[we]] all recognise, in the current common fisheries policy and in the policy that we are creating for the coming years.

3706	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], the [[President]] of the Council and the [[Commissioner]] have rightly observed that [[we]] have managed to set in motion a process of reform in Turkey, but one that still has many, many deficiencies.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb

3712	Another very interesting point addressed by the [[rapporteur]] is that of the psychological treatment of multiple sclerosis, a disease which, because it generally affects young [[people]] at what should be the most productive time of their lives, causes them to face an uncertain future, both from the social and the professional points of view.	Amb,Amb

3720	[[I]] regret that the amendment tabled by my colleagues, Mr [[Reul]], Mrs [[Laperrouze]], Mrs [[Trautmann]] and [[others]], for which I voted, has not been adopted by [[Parliament]], since it provided for a balanced alternative to the mere ownership unbundling of energy networks, while safeguarding the independence of that unbundling.	Amb,Male,Female,Female,Amb,Amb
3721	From the point of view of [[citizens']] participation in the political life of Europe, it is very important for that programme - and it is not by chance that the European Commission is financing such a programme on fundamental rights and citizenship - to contain policies and measures encouraging citizens to play more of a role in political life, in the life of the [[institutions]], and therefore, for instance, in events such as the European elections.	Amb,Amb
3722	[[author]]. - (NL) Mr [[President]], in presidential elections [[we]] increasingly see continuing uncertainty as to whether the preferred [[candidate]] of the ruling [[government]] has actually won a true majority of the votes as well as just a large number of votes.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb

3725	[[Member]] of the Commission. - Mr [[President]], I am pleased to express the Commission's support for Parliament's amendments to the UCITS IV proposal.	Amb,Male
3726	Now Mrs [[Kallenbach]] has given [[him]] her minute of time out of a sense of solidarity with a [[colleague]] from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.	Female,Male,Amb

3729	[[We]] have also heard no answer about how we are to strengthen the [[producers']] position in their struggle against the supermarkets.	Amb,Amb
3730	Finally, as Mrs [[Malmström]] has said, democracy building is much more than about elections: it is about building pluralist civil society.	Female

3733	The absence of the [[Council]] is a complete misunderstanding, and [[I]] am inclined to agree with the proposal of the previous [[speaker]] that in this situation, [[we]] should postpone the part of the debate which concerns the Council and wait until [[representatives]] of the Council get here.

3737	(ES) Mr [[President]], Mrs [[Győri]], welcome to this House, which has been yours, and [[we]] think that, although this is not a subject that you have had knowledge of, you are taking an interest in this asylum package, which was something that the Belgian [[Presidency]] was driving forward, in order for the Hungarian Presidency to do the same.	Male,Female,Amb,Amb
3738	[[I]] would agree with the previous [[speaker]] from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance when she said that [[we]] should exercise care when considering this procedural decision.	Amb,Female,Amb
3739	So, having [[lobbyists]] or [[stakeholders]] with conflicting interests is a good thing: what is important is that the [[judge]] - and therefore also the MEP - maintains his freedom of thought, independence, and his honest search for the common good.	Amb,Amb,Male
3740	[[I]] am voting for this proposal, as I agree with the [[rapporteur]] when she says that union is strength.	Amb,Female

3744	All those present here - and unfortunately there are more [[members]] of the public than [[Members]] of Parliament here - know that ECU 1.3 billion is quite a significant sum for a normal [[household]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
3745	[[I]] still congratulate [[you]] on one remark made to me this morning - by an old Hull trawler-[[owner]] who still operates part of our deep-sea fleet - that at last you have got a [[Commissioner]] who says what she thinks.	Amb,Amb,Female,Female
3746	[[You]] have confessed the motive for these decisions - and [[I]] mean 'confessed' , because this was indeed a crime, and may prove to be a crime against [[humanity]] if an epidemic has to be declared in a few years' time.	Amb,Amb,Amb
3747	The [[farmers]] must repair the mistakes of senior [[civil servants]] and industry, but the agricultural budget must not support those same farmers!	Amb,Amb
3748	Furthermore, Commissioner [[Monti]], [[I]] ask you to vigilantly ensure, on behalf of the Commission, the faithful implementation of the directive in this regard and to assure [[us]] that you will not hesitate to note failures in the implementation and to punish them, if necessary, for we also have to convince [[lawyers]], often young, that this directive is an opportunity for them and that it is an opportunity for Europe. I believe it; it is still necessary for it to become a reality, and that depends largely on you, Mr Commissioner.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
3749	[[We]] hope, Madam [[Commissioner]], that, after this initial stage, a good dialogue will continue between [[Parliament]] and the [[Commission]], with cooperation and transparency, so that together we can finally provide the European Union with an efficient and effective framework research programme that can begin to catch up on the serious European delay compared with the United States which, with their federal [[organization]], have for some time been able to amass substantial financial resources and huge human resources.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
3750	[[I]] also want to mention paragraph 10 of Mrs [[Bloch von Blottnitz']] report, which states that there are overlaps between the various Member States' own programmes and the EU programme, and suggests how to be a little more efficient.	Amb,Female

3753	Madam [[President]], [[I]] would like to begin by congratulating the three [[rapporteurs]], although in my speech I am going to concentrate on the report by Mr [[Evans]] due to its great importance and interest in the languages and cultures of the European Union.	Female,Amb,Amb,Male

3756	It is a great shame and [[we]] would have done Parliament a service and paid one of our [[Members]] a great tribute had we been able to say these things to his face, in his presence and give him the recognition and tribute he deserves.	Amb,Male
3757	He is an acknowledged [[expert]] in this area, and [[I]] believe [[we]] must recognise that.	Male,Amb,Amb
3758	In our Member States, the same [[ministers]] - [[I]] am not referring to you personally, Mr [[Fischer]], but this does need to be said in this kind of debate - who adopt a whole range of regulations and directives in Brussels from Monday to Friday, announce the following Saturday or Sunday that once again Brussels has decided some sort of nonsense.	Amb,Amb,Male
3759	This suggestion comes, notably, from local elected [[representatives]] in an ultraperipheral region, and [[I]] would thank the [[rapporteur]] sincerely for having included it in his text, thereby giving it weight and strength.	Amb,Amb,Male

Amb,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
3839	Once again, [[President]], [[I]] can imagine easier tasks.	Amb,Amb
3840	Mr [[President]], [[I]] should like to express our appreciation for the [[Commission]] and the [[rapporteur' s]] report, and [[we]] hope that, thanks to that report, policy in this area will really improve in the short term.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3841	However, if the honourable [[Member]] is making the point that in order to deal with these global problems [[we]] need a greater commitment to multilateralism and to multinational [[institutions]]; if she is saying that there should be one message from this [[Parliament]] to the US [[Administration]] and to other [[administrations]] around the world, then she will have [[me]] leading the standing ovation for her remarks, because she is entirely right.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3842	[[Ludford]] recommendation (B5­340/2001)	Amb
3843	[[I]] assured this House that although [[delegations]] are formally delegations of the [[Commission]], [[we]] have made it absolutely clear that they should regard themselves as serving [[Parliament]], the [[High Representative]] and the other Community institutions as well.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3844	It is scandalous that [[workers]] continue to risk their health in order to earn a living.	Amb
3845	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would ask you to communicate this Parliament's indignation to the Spanish Presidency of the Council at this blatant aggression against a diplomatic [[representative]] of the European Union in the fulfilment of his duties, while he was in Palestine with the [[President]] of the Palestinian Authority, something which the Israeli [[authorities]] had prior knowledge of, as the honourable [[Members]] and the President know.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
3846	The [[Convention]] must also not forget this.	Amb
3847	Madam [[President]], this budget has just been described as nostalgic, catastrophic and historic. [[I]] believe it is a sound, well-balanced budget and I would like to thank Mr [[Färm]] and Mr [[Stenmarck]] for their perceptive work.	Female,Amb,Male,Male
3848	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would first of all like to thank the European Parliament, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and more particularly Mr [[Markov]], for the attention that they have given to the EBRD.	Male,Amb,Male
3849	[[I]] must also mention a third dimension, which Mr [[Markov]] referred to just now, which is its political dimension.	Amb,Male
3850	The German Development [[Minister]] condescended to hold a joint press conference with a number of NGOs at the time, but she failed to give adequate support to civil [[society's]] direct participation in the negotiations.	Female,Amb
3851	Mrs [[Villiers]] complained that financial services are not included.	Female
3852	The [[Commission]] is very pleased with the close cooperation of the rapporteur, Mrs [[Fraga Estévez]], and the [[members]] of the Committee on Fisheries during our work on this important proposal.	Amb,Female,Amb
3853	As [[draftsman]] of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs [[Hieronymi]], on the proposed improvements to the proposed programme.	Male,Female
3854	[[I]] hope that the male [[Members]] in the Chamber today, as well as the female [[Members]], will vote in favour of my amendment.	Amb,Male,Female
3855	[[We]] finally have certainty about when the digital tachograph will be introduced, and [[I]] am pleased to see Commissioner [[Barrot]] again taking a very firm line on this.	Amb,Amb,Amb
3856	[[I]] can do no other than agree with the last [[speaker]] when he says that what is needed in the final analysis is a pragmatic approach characterised by partnership, but one that does not involve [[us]] abandoning our principles.	Amb,Male,Amb
3857	In conclusion, [[I]] want to thank Mrs [[Sommer]] for her efforts.	Amb,Female
3858	Mr [[President]], Mr [[Potočnik]], [[I]] would like to congratulate the [[rapporteur]] on his excellent report and stress that the European Union must continue to attach importance to scientific research and technological development in nanosciences and nanotechnologies, which, furthermore, are one of the thematic priorities of the Seventh Framework Programme.	Male,Male,Amb,Male
3859	on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) [[Madam President]], I, too, as a former [[fellow]]-[[member]] of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, wish you every success in the exercise of your functions.	Female,Amb,Amb
3860	There is now a concrete action plan; the [[Commissioner]] has made it quite plain that he is prepared to suspend payments if Greece fails to meet the conditions or carry out the action plan correctly.	Male
3861	Therefore [[I]] should like to thank the [[rapporteur]] and congratulate her on a very thorough and comprehensive report and I should also like to thank the other [[committees]] for contributing to it.	Amb,Female,Amb
3862	As Ms [[Hennicot-Schoepges]] said, [[we]] are not going to lose identity; we offer to share the identity between universities or existing centres and the EIT which is going to be established.	Female,Amb
3863	[[I]] wish to remind the [[House]] once more that the [[rapporteur]] visited the country twice just before she submitted her analysis of the situation.	Amb,Amb,Female
3864	It is therefore of fundamental importance that [[we]] protect ourselves using temporary campaigns such as those initiated by Mrs [[Záborská]] during the 2006 football World Cup, which also deserve to be continued this time.	Amb,Female
3865	Of course Europe needs to open up to training the [[elites]] of the whole world.	Amb
3866	[[I]] also support the amendments tabled by Mrs [[Roure]] and Mrs [[Lefrançois]].	Amb,Female,Female
3867	Some [[children]] are fortunate enough to receive this care from secondary care-givers like [[fathers]], [[grandparents]], other [[relatives]], close [[neighbours]] - people who are committed to them and part of their life on an ongoing basis.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
3868	[[rapporteur]]. - Madam [[President]], can I first of all say that my colleague Mr [[Vidal-Quadras]] sends his apologies?	Amb,Female,Male
3869	[[author]]. - (FI) Mr [[President]], [[we]] really ought to spare a thought here for the human rights [[activists]] who were recently murdered in the North Caucasus and light a candle in memory of them.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
3870	Secondly, with regard to the details concerning the [[person]] formally charged, which national [[authorities]] exchange through the notifications, [[I]] support the idea that it is important to ensure an adequate level of data protection and that it should be specified in this Framework Decision what kind of personal data is exchanged.	Amb,Amb,Amb
3871	Madam [[President]], [[I]] supported this report because I think that there is a need for a new paradigm in the world - a new paradigm in which [[we]] shift from completely money- and profit-centred decision making to [[human being]]- and [[community]]-centred decision making, and from the logic of competition to the logic of justice.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3872	Mr [[Sassoli]], given that you asked this question, and that Mr [[Mauro]] has put forward a proposal in response to yours, would you like to take the floor, in order to reply?	Male,Male
3873	[[I]] believe that EUR 0.003 per litre of milk produced in Portugal (calculations provided by [[producers]]) is a pittance for a problem that has been dragging on now for so many months, especially if the [[Minister]] for Agriculture uses this money for the expected reforms, as he has already announced.	Amb,Amb,Male
3874	[[She]] is a highly educated and powerful [[figure]] who thoroughly understands the challenges of Europe's future.	Female,Female
3875	Let [[me]] finish by saying that the work that [[we]] present here today is the product of a joint effort by all the [[members]] of the Committee on Fisheries, particularly the shadow [[rapporteurs]], with whom we worked very hard, and also with the Commission, the Secretariat of the European Parliament, the [[advisor]] to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and other [[advisors]] to other political groups, and, of course, my office and my [[assistant]] for fisheries.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
3876	(DE) Mr [[President]], [[I]] would briefly like to clarify as my fellow [[Member]] perhaps misunderstood as a result of the translation.	Male,Amb,Amb
3877	(FR) Madam [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], the issue of appointing additional [[MEPs]] is not new; let [[us]] remember that our fellow Members Mr [[Severin]] and Mr [[Lamassoure]] already worked on this matter during the previous parliamentary term.	Female,Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Male,Male
3878	From this point of view, not a day passes without the media or a top-ranking [[politician]] talking about the need for a stronger European budget.	Amb
3879	Mr [[President]], you know as well as [[I]] do that this is nonsense.	Male,Amb
3880	Previously [[he]] was saying that agreement was impossible, that only a miracle performed by the [[Virgin]] could make it possible and was making rather cruder comments about our dropping our trousers before Rabat, for instance.	Male,Female
3881	As it happens, [[we]] have a woman [[Minister]] for Justice in Ireland who is President-in-Office of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and would be particularly sensitive to the issues which have been raised here.	Amb,Female
3882	[[Countries]] which wish to have more extensive cooperation in fields such as foreign policy and justice can reach agreements on such matters outside the Treaty.	Amb
3883	Madam [[President]], in contrast to my [[group]], [[I]] have signed and will be voting in my personal capacity for the compromise resolution on Albania, because I approve of what it says and agree that there is an urgent need to send an international humanitarian [[mission]].	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
3884	Mr [[Smith]], [[I]] will make a note of your concern, but as you know, it is up to the [[Commission]] to decide which of the [[Commissioners]] respond to the questions which have been raised.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
3885	Madam [[President]], [[I]] would suggest one simple way of overcoming the problem of the distance between [[Members']] offices and the Hemicycle.	Female,Amb,Amb
3886	The search for lasting peace and national reconciliation assumes, Mrs [[Aelvoet]], the return of a regime legitimized by free, fair and transparent elections.	Female
3887	Mr [[President]], since [[I]] was the one to negotiate the compromise on behalf of our [[group]], I need to make one or two things clear at this point. It is correct - and [[we]] have since verified this - that Mrs [[Green]], the other [[MEPs]] and myself were not present for a while, but rather our [[colleagues]] discussed among themselves what might be possible, and that is the way things were actually discussed.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
3888	Let [[me]] start by thanking the [[rapporteur]] for his report and for the words he has just pronounced.	Amb,Male
3889	The Spanish [[authorities]] have informed [[me]] that Mr [[Carlos María Bru Purón]] has been appointed to replace Mrs [[Díez de Rivera Icaza]] with effect from 4 February 1999.	Amb,Amb,Male,Female
3890	It was International [[Women's]] Day yesterday and [[I]] know that many of our female [[colleagues]] take offence at the fact that the Rules in some languages refer only to [[Members]] in the masculine form - as he and not as he or she - and the rule changes would also cater for that particular problem.	Female,Amb,Female,Amb
3891	What Mr [[Jové Peres]] says in his report is extremely important. It is particularly essential to maintain the balance between [[producer]] organisations and [[producers]] and to guarantee that the latter can remain faithful to their organisations without this constituting a kind of controlled economy in which they are forced, like [[slaves]], to sell to poorly managed organisations.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
3892	When Mr [[Cook]] was appointed Foreign Secretary he launched an ethical foreign policy containing amongst other things a commitment to a stringent code of conduct on arms export controls.	Male
3893	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], allow [[me]] first to congratulate my [[colleague]] on her first report.	Male,Amb,Amb,Female
3894	Nevertheless, [[Commissioner]], [[I]] have to point out that in this area of making [[women' s]] representation the norm, the [[Commission]] has had a hypocritical attitude for more than twenty years.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb

3912	There were several arguments between the [[artist]] and the [[guild]] after he joined it, among other things because [[Stoskopff]] loved his freedom as an independent and self-responsible artist and did not want to operate a workshop with [[apprentices]], as was usually done.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb

4011	One [[Member]] said earlier, and [[I]] agree with her, that these procedural, criminal and other administrative measures may have the opposite of the intended effect and could strangle civil liberties and the rights of the [[individual]].	Female,Amb,Amb
4012	On that point, let [[me]] assure Mrs [[Thyssen]] that the [[Commission]] has taken the necessary measures to improve its own compliance with the 60-day payment deadline and, in cases where Commission [[departments]] delay payment without good reason, they will have to pay interest for the period of delay.

4016	[[We]] are all concerned about putting the European [[taxpayer' s]] money to good use, and [[I]] was extremely sorry to hear our Dutch [[colleague]] leaping to the defence of "her" [[taxpayers]] in an outburst which she felt was appropriate, but which actually showed utter contempt for any concept of European solidarity.

4083	For me as a [[Finn]], and a member who has been active in matters concerning agriculture and the health and transportation of [[animals]], it is most important that those EU states where TSEs do not occur at all will in the future too be guaranteed the right to inspect as fully as is necessary the transportation of live animals.

Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4088	In conclusion, [[I]] would like to give an example: last week, the Italian Parliament adopted a new law on welfare which was proposed by a [[Minister]] - a woman, like the three [[representatives]] of the three institutions.	Amb,Female,Amb
4089	There is, therefore, coherence between the three initiatives that are the subject of my report and of the reports by Mrs [[Karamanou]] and Mrs [[Roure]] in that the framework decision forces the Member States to comply with the outcome, in that Europol' s competence is extended to cover money laundering in terms of investigations and in that a convention improves mutual legal assistance.

4093	There have been quite a few [[speakers]] here today who have stated that there are things in the budget process that could be done better and that the [[institutions]] should in future work better together, even though this budget has proceeded very peacefully under the expert direction of Parliament' s Mr [[Costa Neves]] and Mrs [[Buitenweg]].	Amb,Amb,Male,Female
4094	Mr [[President]], Mr [[High Representative]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], the information presented today by the High [[Representative]] gives [[us]] hope despite the gravity of the situation.	Male,Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Amb

4098	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[Chairman]] of the Committee on Fisheries and dear friend, Mr [[Stevenson]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] am speaking to you at a particularly difficult time for the autonomous region of the Azores, as has already been said.

4100	The Swedish [[Minister]] for Equal Opportunities has indicated to the Swedish [[Parliament]] the readiness of her government to consider modification of the Swedish law on abortion so that the Swedish [[authorities]] would cover the costs of an abortion, not only for Swedish [[nationals]] and [[people]] residing in Sweden, but also for [[nationals]] from other Member States who have an abortion in Sweden.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4101	Nonetheless, because [[we]] cannot talk of equality of the sexes only in the workplace, we welcome the initiative by Mrs [[Diamantopoulou]] for a new directive based on Article 13 of the Treaty, which will ban any discrimination in access to goods and services.	Amb,Female
4102	This, however, is the question put by my [[colleague]] to the Presidency and to which, in her absence – she is, in fact, ill – [[I]] shall again draw the [[House]]’[[s]] attention: what will be your attitude regarding the request presented by the Spanish [[Government]]?	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4103	In fact, the [[official]] informed OLAF himself of his legal action, which is currently under preliminary investigation.	Male
4104	[[We]] are not aware of the circumstances of his disappearance but it would appear that he has been kidnapped, and since we are talking about an [[official]] from one of our institutions, [[I]] believe it would be appropriate for Parliament to demonstrate its solidarity in some way, both with the [[citizen]] in question and his [[family]] and with our sister institution, the European Commission.	Amb,Male,Amb,Male,Amb
4105	First of all [[I]] should like to respond to the criticisms made by various fellow [[Members]] including Mrs [[Breyer]] and Mrs [[Foglietta]], who allege that I have expressed my personal viewpoint and not that of the [[Committee]] on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.	Amb,Female,Female,Female,Amb
4106	Finally, [[I]] should like to turn to three other areas, namely definitions, [[producer]] responsibility and batteries integrated in appliances.	Amb,Amb
4107	[[We]] certainly do bring this question up with US [[representatives]], including and starting with the [[President]], and with the [[Secretary of State]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4108	[[I]] should like to thank the [[Commissioner]] for her comprehensive answer to my question.	Amb,Female
4109	[[I]] have tried my utmost to avoid mixing up the discussions on Parliament’s seat with the discussions on whether tax money has been well spent. I would like to put it to Parliament today that the only people who have consistently mixed up these two debates have been, firstly, the [[Mayor]] of Strasbourg, who, when she addressed [[us]] during her hearing, reminded us that having such a debate was in fact quite dangerous because the Alsace region has a very symbolic meaning.	Amb,Female,Amb
4110	The [[Chancellor]] herself did, incidentally, imply that the experiment of the European single market could serve as a model for this new area.	Female
4111	Firstly, as Mr [[Cornillet]] already mentioned, an even-handed resolution on East Africa was rejected in Bridgetown, because it was preceded by separate voting, despite the fact that a huge majority in the [[Assembly]] were in favour.	Male,Amb
4112	[[We]] know - and a study published in The Lancet has demonstrated this once more - that heavy metals cause damage to the nervous system and also lasting, irreparable brain damage, particularly in [[children]].	Amb,Amb
4113	Up to now, certain [[institutions]] such as the Council of Europe and, sadly, the European Parliament have set in motion such unhelpful actions as the appointment of strange [[commissions]] to try to find alleged CIA prisons in Europe.	Amb,Amb
4114	When [[you]] think that a [[head of state]] of the only remaining superpower in the world recently threatened a possible third world war, that strikes fear right to my heart.	Amb,Amb
4115	[[I]] am very happy that [[we]] are now agreed that a [[child]] has a right to a [[family]] , irrespective of whether it is the child's own family, a foster family or through national or international adoption.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4116	Firstly, congratulations on the [[Commissioner's]] lucid analysis which [[we]] hope will be followed by concrete action, action in which [[Parliament]] - and we also call on the [[President]] of Parliament here - will also be involved, because the waste problem in Naples does not just have to do with the minutiae of disposal, the environment and any other matter, but, in our view, is becoming a national and European problem.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4117	The [[adult]] learning agenda needs to be pushed forward.	Amb
4118	A report was published in 2004 and another last year detailing the horrible conditions of the average female [[prisoner]] in my own constituency in Northern Ireland.	Female
4119	in writing. - (FR) [[I]] voted in favour of discharge for the [[Director]] of the European Agency for Reconstruction in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2006 on the basis of the report by my Austrian colleague Mr [[Hans-Peter Martin]], which recommends to Parliament to give discharge.	Amb,Amb,Male
4120	[[I]] should also like to thank the [[Commissioner]] for his answer to my question on the uncertainty over the [[agency]] and its role.	Amb,Male,Amb
4121	the oral question to the [[Commission]] by Mr [[Markov]] and Mr [[Fjellner]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on International Trade, on the stepping-stone Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and Ghana, of the other part - B6-0206/2009),	Amb,Male,Male,Amb
4122	As Mrs [[Ludford]] said, very correctly, there are deep practical considerations as to why this is important for [[us]] and why this is not just a reactive measure.	Female,Amb
4123	The [[Chair]] of the Committee on Regional Development herself was the rapporteur for the proposal, which has allowed it to be submitted to plenary for voting without it being put to debate.	Female
4124	The initial draft of Slovakia's position on the Danube Strategy has been discussed by the [[Council]], [[Ministries]], self-governing regions, [[municipalities]] and [[companies]] continue to work on the strategy.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4125	To our Spanish Presidency [[colleague]] preparing for this Friday's UN vote, [[I]] say: do not pursue EU consensus at all costs.	Amb,Amb
4126	Any [[person]] who is in possession of a document which proves that he legally resides in a Member State should be able to move freely within an area where there are no internal borders.	Male
4127	Hamas claims it is a legal [[actor]] observing the Geneva Conventions and therefore [[he]] is a prisoner of war, but Israel, in my view rightly, regards him as an abductee from the moment he was seized.	Male,Male
4128	At the moment, only the [[army's]] presence in the streets is delaying the plans of some [[Christians]] and [[Muslims]] for taking revenge.	Amb,Amb,Amb
4129	[[Parliament]] aims to strengthen the procedures for the transfer of [[passenger]] name record (PNR) data to third countries.	Amb,Amb
4130	However, as Mrs [[Gebhardt]] said in her speech, these rules for the liberalisation and development of the market also provide real guidance on safety, which is of great importance for construction sector [[workers]], but also [[consumers]].	Female,Amb,Amb
4131	[[We]] sought [[expert]] legal advice.	Amb,Amb
4132	[[I]] also believe that it is unfortunate that there is no female [[candidate]] for a post at this level and hope that the [[candidates]] for the position of [[Executive Director]] would reflect a better choice.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
4133	Madam [[President]], [[I]] do not like to be in tow or obligated to [[anybody]] and neither do the Irish [[people]] - an independent race.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
4134	Contrary to the view of one of the previous [[speakers]], Mr [[Kellett-Bowman]] made it very clear that there is no assurance at all that this centre is performing its functions efficiently.	Amb,Male
4135	Since 1 July 1990, [[farmers']] [[wives]] also receive benefit for a 'non-working period' of one and a half years following the birth of a [[child]].	Amb,Female,Amb
4136	[[I]] should therefore, Mr [[Commissioner]], like to put one or two proposals to you for alleviating the situation in the Community rice sector.	Amb,Male
4137	[[They]] can stay at home, as can the [[man]] for the last six months if he so chooses, and, most important, with a guarantee of employment, which makes it easier for [[women]] to return to working life.	Female,Male,Female
4138	Finally, it concludes that any breach of the Code of Conduct may lead to the withdrawal of the pass issued to the [[person]] concerned and, if appropriate, his [[firm]].	Male,Amb
4139	As for the secrecy stamp on the report the [[Commissioner]] says that [[governments]] also have secret reports.	Amb,Amb
4140	Another matter on which the [[Committee]] on Petitions has been lobbied intensely is the difficulties many [[teachers]] experience working in other Member States.	Amb,Amb
4141	Recognizing the work of my [[colleague]], the rapporteur, [[I]] should like to go along with his thoughts on the budgetary amount earmarked for this future regulation - 35 million ECU over 6 years - and wonder about the real political motivation behind the promotion of this type of transport.	Male,Amb
4142	The bomb attack on the Global Television station in Puno last October, the physical assaults against three [[journalists]] from the En Persona television programme at Naña on 25 June, the ferocious attack against the political [[editor]] of the newspaper Ojo at San Miguel on 1 July, and this week's removal of Peruvian nationality from [[Baruch Ivcher]], owner of Peru's TV Channel Two, represent an attack on independent journalism which should be prevented by constitutional safeguards.	Amb,Amb,Amb
4143	Mr [[President]], a few days ago an eight-year-old [[child]] was brutally raped, then beaten and finally burnt; his remains were scattered around.	Male,Male
4144	It is not enough that the [[Commissioner]] should say that she was tired and therefore unable to speak to [[us]].	Female,Amb
4145	There is even a case for substitution on the 34-[[person]] EFC.	Amb
4146	Later this morning [[you]] will be voting on the appointment of the future President, [[Romano Prodi]].	Amb,Amb
4147	[[Lenin]] himself referred to leftism as a [[child]] illness, and so in this Chamber [[we]] find childishness, maturity and longevity.	Male,Amb,Amb

4225	[[She]] is not the [[leader]] of the [[majority]] and [[I]] must therefore register my protest.	Female,Female,Amb,Amb
4226	Mr [[President]], [[I]] should like to thank you for allowing me to run over time, but I needed to comment on a whole series of particularly complicated amendments and articles in order to give the [[House]] the best possible understanding of the points which can be accepted and, as you can see, they are numerous.	Male,Amb,Amb
4227	As [[rapporteur]], he has done some very good work, including work of a very cooperative nature, and [[I]] should like to thank him very much for that.	Male,Amb
4228	[[I]] know I shall have the chance at the end of the debate to provide some additional comments, but I should like to reply to some remarks made by Mrs [[Randzio-Plath]].	Amb,Female
4229	(EL) Mr [[President]], every new science that emerges significantly improves our quality of life but generally harbours the danger of innovations being hijacked by [[groups]] of interests.	Male,Amb
4230	My compliments to the [[interpreters]] on keeping up with the [[speaker]]!	Amb,Amb
4231	Mr [[President]], honourable [[Members]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would like to begin by thanking you, Mrs [[Attwooll]], for preparing this report.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Female
4232	Once again, on 8 June, [[I]] wrote to the Greek [[minister]] asking for a follow-up to his initial reply of 27 April.	Amb,Male
4233	The [[Commissioner]] responsible deserves particular recognition. He is present here today and [[I]] should like to take this opportunity to thank him for all he has done.	Male,Amb
4234	Moreover, in the interests of male-female equality, [[I]] am also going to organise a football match between female married and single [[Members]] of the European Parliament.	Amb,Female
4235	Mr [[President]], the ever-increasing threat from terrorist [[organisations]], and the greater concentration of terror in the murdering of public [[figures]], with the recent hideous murder of one of the Netherlands' leading [[politicians]], make this matter one of vital importance today to [[Parliament]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4236	A number of [[speakers]] - Mrs [[Villiers]], in particular - have also mentioned the value of transparency in the state aid register too.	Female,Female
4237	In conclusion [[I]] should like to compliment the [[rapporteur]] on his courageous, lucid and valuable report.	Amb,Male
4238	My report aims to answer both the legitimate concerns of thousands of [[women]] and the need to put [[patient]] safety first.	Female,Amb
4239	Would Mr [[Watson]] like to tell [[us]] whether he deliberately misled the [[House]], or is this just another example of British Liberal [[Democrats']] inability to call failing [[Commissioners]] to account?	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4240	Mr [[President]], if [[I]] have observed correctly, you have not yet taken a vote on Amendment No 75 tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats.	Male,Amb
4241	The amount of progress that has been made is a credit to Mrs [[Lambert]], the [[Commission]] and the [[staff]] on both sides, and indeed the other [[groups]] in this House.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
4242	With regard to the Conference, Italy has been committed from the very beginning to achieving consensus on a high-profile document, without any watered-down compromises; a document that would allow the Union of the future to function and to stand as a [[leader]] on the world stage.	Amb
4243	More than three million [[children]] – one-third of them [[girls]] – flooded the classrooms in Afghanistan.	Female,Female
4244	Mr [[President]], today, on International [[Women’s]] Day, [[I]] wish not only to draw attention to the entire issue of discrimination against [[women]], but also to raise the issue of [[women]] who are victims of war.	Male,Female,Amb,Female,Female
4245	As [[rapporteur]] of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I welcome the revision of Framework Directive 89/109/EEC, and thank Mrs [[Thors]] for her good cooperation.	Amb,Female
4246	– [[Madam President]], [[I]] too would like to congratulate the [[rapporteur]] on her work and say that separating the Daphne III programme from the programme on drugs prevention and information, as requested by this [[Parliament]], was crucial to the proper operation of Daphne.	Female,Amb,Female,Amb
4247	It is no longer enough for a female [[politician]] to centre her media discourse on the real or supposed male chauvinism of her [[opponents]], as [[we]] can see from the sad 'example' provided by the French Socialist Party's internal campaign for the presidential nomination.	Female,Amb,Amb
4248	If a [[woman]] finds the courage to put herself forward for a leading position, she has to withdraw her candidature if another female [[candidate]] puts herself forward for the same position, so that at least one woman can get herself elected amongst the crowds of [[men]].	Female,Female,Male
4249	Once again, more than 50 per cent of the [[speakers]] in this debate are women, the first of which is [[Marie-Hélène Descamps]], the rapporteur.	Female,Female
4250	[[I]] am pleased that Mrs [[Descamps]] has presented a very good report, which points the way forward and shows [[us]] what can and could be done.	Amb,Female,Amb
4251	in writing. - (FR) This report has the great merit of clearly defining the rights of the [[child]], but above all of condemning almost exhaustively the dangers children are exposed to: from exposure at an early age to depictions of horror, pornography and violence in the media to honour crimes, forced marriages and genital mutilation on cultural or religious grounds.	Amb
4252	(PL) Mr [[President]], the European Union's role is to legislate and to devise solutions that ensure, firstly, stability and development for farms, secondly, a suitable income level for [[farmers]], comparable to levels in other occupations, thirdly, food security for [[society]] and fourthly, the availability of affordable food for low [[earners]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
4253	[[I]] should like to say quite clearly to you, Mrs [[in 't Veld]], that the [[Commission]] fully shares your concerns and I shall, of course, be informing the relevant [[colleague]] of the criticism you have expressed on the lack of transparency in the process and asking him to ensure greater transparency.	Amb,Female,Amb,Male
4254	[[He]] hugged [[me]], kissed me and said: "Please, [[mama]], go!”	Male,Female,Female
4255	Obviously, when a compromise is needed, [[each]] must take a step back so that [[others]] can do the same, and [[I]] therefore think that Mr [[El Khadraoui's]] words were wise: [[we]] have done the best we could under the circumstances.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
4256	The [[workers]] are ready to make sacrifices for this cause, and [[we]] expect the same from all the [[decision makers]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
4257	[[I]] would like to underline that although gender equality was not a priority, the Swedish Presidency also played a role in increasing the number of women [[Commissioners]] and in the appointment of a female [[High Representative]].	Amb,Female,Female
4258	And that is exactly what the [[Goldstone]] report has done - although it was not just Mr Goldstone, it was also his two female [[colleagues]].	Male,Female
4259	[[I]] would therefore like to call on the [[High Representative]] to make use of her new powers and to speed up the negotiations with Russia.	Amb,Female
4260	That is, of course, something that [[we]] found repeatedly during the detailed negotiations, because it was already clear at that point that perhaps one [[person]] may interpret something one way and [[others]] may interpret it somewhat differently.	Amb,Amb,Amb
4261	[[I]] voted in favour of this resolution on international adoption in the European Union, which is striving for the welfare of every [[child]] and recognises the right of [[orphans]] or abandoned [[children]] to have a [[family]] and be protected.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4262	(IT) Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would like to thank the [[Commissioner]] for having devoted her attention to the issue of Tunisia.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Female
4263	(HU) Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], today [[we]] are all a little Japanese.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb
4264	The case pending against [[her]] has its origins in an incident dating back to early 2004, when she was not yet a [[Member]] of the European Parliament.	Female,Female
4265	The fact that she, as the democratic [[leader]] of the opposition in that country, is asking the European Union to do that should surely be a signal to [[us]] to take action immediately.	Female,Amb
4266	What [[I]] would like to ask is this: if the [[House]] adopts a resolution calling for economic sanctions, which the opposition [[leader]] in Burma herself has also called for, will the [[Commission]] be prepared to adapt its proposals so that the [[Council]] is able to approve the necessary decisions at its next meeting?	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
4267	But first let [[me]] sincerely thank my honourable [[colleague]] for his clear and also courageous report, which he has drawn up with his usual thoroughness.	Amb,Male
4268	It is in fact the [[women]] of Kabul themselves who have denounced to the whole world the scandalous and precarious conditions in which hospitals which, clearly, no longer have [[nurses]] or female [[doctors]], now find themselves.	Female,Female,Female
4269	[[I]] agree with Mrs [[Kirsten Jensen]] that there is a difference between what is possible at a Community level and what is possible at a national level, and I would add that when [[we]] tackle the question of voluntary agreements, it is because we believe there is a need for some firmer rules of procedure than those that we have today.	Amb,Female,Amb
4270	[[I]] will note, though, the attention several honourable [[Members]] have given to the problems of small- and medium-sized enterprises, for example Mrs [[Quisthoudt-Rowohl]] or Mrs [[Plooij van Gorsel]] or Mrs [[Vaz da Silva]].	Amb,Female,Female,Female,Female
4271	[[I]] make it without prejudice to the detailed critique which will follow in the coming weeks.	Amb
4272	Mr [[President]], there is a rather grim joke going around the Palace of Westminster that the British [[Government's]] interpretation of BSE is 'blame [[someone]] else' .	Male,Amb,Amb
4273	Madam [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]]. [[I]] totally agree with Mrs [[Lulling]].	Female,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Female
4274	It is certainly true that the [[Commission]] always has a whole series of investigations in progress regarding [[cartels]], agreements and possible abuses of dominant positions.	Amb,Amb
4275	A French [[firm]] should certainly be able to manufacture radios in south-east Asia, but the health of the female [[employees]] there is just as important as that of a female [[employee]] in the first world.	Amb,Female,Female
4276	The next item is the report (A4-0021/98) by Mr [[Giansily]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on Budgetary Control, on the Court of [[Auditors]]' Special Report No 5/97 on management of the Community cereals trade involving export refunds, special import arrangements and regional aid schemes, together with the [[Commission's]] replies (C4-0351/97).	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
4277	It was also unfortunate, for reasons outside her control, that the British [[Minister]] was unable to attend the original meeting.	Female
4278	I understand your reference to the Fontainebleau Agreement as a UK [[Member]] of Parliament.	Amb
4279	The second involves pursuing policies that allow affirmation of the joint imperatives of competitiveness and social progress at multilateral level. This presupposes very strong objectives such as the abolition of [[child]] labour or education of [[children]], objectives that must be developed at the same time perhaps as pursuing other possibilities such as setting up or improving upon systems of social protection.	Amb,Amb
4280	If the taxable [[person]] is identified for VAT purposes in several Member States, then if he is identified in the Member State in which he has incurred the VAT-bearing expenditure, the VAT is deducted in that state. If the taxable person is not identified in the Member State in which he has incurred the VAT-bearing expenditure, the VAT is deducted in the Member State where he supplies goods or services for which the expenditure is used.	Male
4281	Mr [[President]], first of all may [[I]] thank Mrs [[Jackson]] and congratulate her on her report.	Male,Amb,Female
4282	For its part, the European [[Parliament]] will no longer be prepared to be presumed to be the junior [[partner]] in European decision-making.	Amb,Amb
4283	Mr [[Prodi]], you may not belong to the great Expressionist [[painters]], but [[I]] have faith that your gentle leadership can produce good results.	Male,Amb,Amb
4284	If the [[Commission]] now presents a proposal for revision of the Financial Perspective, think of that bottle, Madam [[Minister]].	Amb,Female
4285	However [[I]] was disappointed, like Mrs [[Stauner]], that [[we]] had very few [[members]] who were women.	Amb,Female,Amb,Female

4531	[[I]] think that the [[person]] who decided on this course of action should have said whatever he wanted to, but he ought to have allowed the sitting to continue normally.	Amb,Male
4532	The reason is often that the young [[teenager]] is discouraged from learning by the rigidities of an education system that sticks to established lines and tries to fit square pegs into round holes.	Amb
4533	[[I]] should like, once again, to thank Mrs [[Dybkjær]] for the excellent, in-depth work contained in her report, which will be most useful to [[us]] in our next report, and I should like especially to thank the French [[Presidency]] and Mrs [[Péry]] for being so pro-active on the issue of equality during their presidency.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Female
4534	Instead, [[we]] are proposing to set up an expert [[group]] with participation from Member States, from non-governmental organisations and from the other relevant [[players]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
4535	[[We]] are concerned, as the [[minister]] said he was, at the recent upsurge in fighting in the northeast of Afghanistan, concerned at the resultant worsening of the humanitarian situation of the [[population]], many thousands of whom have had to flee their homes in order to avoid the conflict.	Amb,Male,Amb
4536	[[I]] remember a deaf-mute [[artist]] who came to ask for my help many times in Italy in applying for a higher pension: his pension was effectively too low to live on and every now and again he was forced to sell one of his fine paintings, one of his works of art.	Amb,Male
4537	The proposals made by Mrs [[Lambert]], whom [[we]] thank for her support, are very useful since they clarify the [[Commission' s]] original proposal and make it more specific.	Female,Amb,Amb
4538	Mr [[President]], [[I]] welcome the paper on the e-Learning initiative and congratulate the [[rapporteur]] on its content.	Male,Amb,Amb

4544	Mr [[President]], during a meeting last Saturday, [[I]] happened to hear a new [[colleague]] of an important [[minister]] describing, with the frankness of a newcomer, his first experience of a Council of Ministers.

4545	It is eleven years since [[she]] was elected as her [[people' s]] legitimate [[leader]].	Female,Amb,Female
4546	The independent press has been suppressed and many [[journalists]], [[politicians]] and political [[opponents]], including former government [[ministers]], have been arrested, accused of treason against the national assembly. There is an increase in repressive measures being taken to control the [[citizens]], especially [[students]], two of whom died while imprisoned in the desert.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4547	Although the structural regulations include equal treatment of [[women]] as a priority and the strategy framework on gender mainstreaming holds remedies in readiness, women earn, varying between countries and business sectors, between 20% and 30% less than their male [[colleagues]].	Female,Male
4548	The bad news is that under the new draconian laws which have been brought in by President [[Mugabe]], the [[editor]] of the daily newspaper which printed the resolution, in full and accurately, has been threatened and charged with a USD 2 000 fine - or two years in prison if he does not pay it.	Amb,Male
4549	Then there is the language regime, a question on which [[I]] differ, with great respect for Mrs [[Palacio Vallelersundi]], and so does my [[group]].	Amb,Female,Amb
4550	The [[Commission]] will initiate an investigation of these cases which have been brought to its attention by Mr [[Rübig]].	Amb,Male
4551	[[I]] agree with Mr [[Poettering]] on that - a policy of this kind is urgently needed.	Amb,Male
4552	With a view to bringing greater security, the US Special Forces [[advisors]] are working together with the [[Karzai]] government to set up a national [[army]] in Afghanistan, but if, on the one hand, the [[soldiers]] of the new army lack weapons, on the other, there appear to be 750 000 armed [[Mujahideen]] belonging to the various ethnic [[groups]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4553	Several honourable [[Members]] - principally [[ladies]], although it should be an issue of just as much importance to [[people]] of my sex as well - referred to gender issues.	Female,Female,Amb
4554	The problems associated with the comparability of qualifications greatly hamper [[labour]] mobility.	Amb
4555	[[I]] should like to focus on the objectives and point out that there can be no valid strategy if the objectives are scaled down. As the [[Commissioner]] stated, the Lisbon objectives are crystal clear.	Amb,Amb
4556	Secondly, [[we]] could use an action network of national public [[organisations]] and national [[MPs]] as a contribution to the Irish conference in April in order to bring language and culture closer to the [[citizen]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4557	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], naturally, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party strongly condemns the murder of the Irishman, Archbishop [[Courtney]], and demands that the [[authorities]] immediately carry out an extensive investigation to find out [[who]] murdered him.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
4558	The most persistent problems in the new Member States have to do with the functioning of the constitutional state, the independence of the [[judiciary]] and freedom of expression of opinion.	Amb
4559	The [[Member]] States will thus still have the right to negotiate and conclude bilateral air service agreements, without need for prior authorisation from the [[Commission]], even if the subject matter of these lies partly within Community competence, provided that they include certain types of clause defined jointly by the Commission and by the Member States.	Amb,Amb
4560	Tourism, as the [[rapporteur]] rightly states in his report, is not only a factor of economic growth; it also makes a substantial contribution to democracy and political equilibrium in developing countries.	Male
4561	Secondly, he has not said that he is the [[author]] of an amendment that states that the petitions focus on the last three years, a period during which Mr [[Camps’]] [[government]] has been in power; the petitions come from a long time before that and his politically-inspired intention is for the regional [[government]] to be blamed, because it is that government — so far with little success, by the way, and long may that continue — that he wants to bring down.	Male,Male,Amb,Amb
4562	Mrs [[Kinnock]] from the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly was there; there were [[Members]] from the Development Committee and the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee, including [[me]].	Female,Amb,Amb
4563	– Mr [[President]], [[I]] should like to refer to the recent crisis which has broken out over the cartoons of the Prophet [[Mohammed]], to which other [[members]] have also referred.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb
4564	It is only normal that we, as [[Members]] of the European Parliament, seek the protection of our [[citizens’]] rights as we fight against terrorism.	Amb,Amb
4565	It is important not to create the impression that a large proportion of these funds is used to pay middle [[men]] such as civil [[servants]] and [[advisers]].	Male,Amb,Amb
4566	on behalf of the GUE/NGL [[Group]]. - (DE) Mr [[President]], Madam [[Chancellor]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], when [[we]] talk of the European dream nowadays, we are usually quoting the American [[Jeremy Rifkin]].	Amb,Male,Female,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
4567	(PT) Madam [[President-in-Office]] of the Council, speaking as a socialist and a woman, I too should like to congratulate Mrs [[Merkel]] on her Presidency.	Female,Female
4568	[[I]] hope that eventually [[governments]] will use medical common sense, and not a [[police]] sledgehammer approach, in dealing with drug-addicted ill [[people]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4569	on behalf of the [[Verts]]/ALE Group. - Mr [[President]], [[I]], too, must beg forgiveness of Mr [[Rocard]] by focusing on one issue - Palestine.	Amb,Male,Amb,Male
4570	[[I]] think that this is very important and that it shows that our female [[Members]] are particularly sensitive regarding such a fundamental issue.	Amb,Female
4571	Here [[I]] must say, Commissioner [[Frattini]], that you are not doing justice to your role.	Amb,Amb
4572	In Eritrea a Swedish [[journalist]] has been in prison for more than six years simply because he exercised his freedom of speech.	Male
4573	Perhaps the [[Commissioner]] could just add his comments on that, because it is coming up for negotiations.	Male
4574	Dear [[colleagues]], [[I]] support the report of Ms [[Gomes]] because it gives crystal clear picture of all the problems accompanying the establishment of the new democratic [[government]] in Iraq, as well as the ways to overcome them.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
4575	In this respect, I will mention Mauritania, which I am familiar with since the European Union sent me there as the [[head]] of the election observation mission.	Amb
4576	This is very important legislation to support disabled [[people]] and [[passengers]] of reduced mobility so [[I]] urge the [[Minister]] to go back to the Council and say to all his 26 [[colleagues]] on the Transport Council and the [[members]] that they should enforce this legislation.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
4577	[[I]] will pass on your appreciation to the [[person]] concerned, and I am sure that she will sign her latest CD for you, Mr [[Watson]].	Amb,Female,Male
4578	[[I]] therefore welcome the report by Mrs [[Svensson]], who has addressed this important issue and presented a balanced report.	Amb,Female
4579	Doubtless this will help improve safety and prevent risks to the health and safety of [[consumers]] and [[workers]] and the environment.	Amb,Amb
4580	However, as [[I]] said, [[women]] work, and [[we]] must do our best to at least ensure that if [[someone]] other than the primary [[care-giver]] is taking care of the [[child]] below the age of two years nine months, that it is someone who can give the child as nurturing a care as possible.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4581	How did Mr [[Hannan]], Mrs [[Wallis]] or Mrs [[Svensson]] vote, to name just a few of my favourite [[Members]]?	Male,Female,Female,Amb
4582	Mr [[President]], as shadow [[rapporteur]] on the recast of the Dublin Regulation, I wish to thank the European Commission for the quality of the text proposed to [[us]].	Male,Amb,Amb
4583	[[I]] would also like to express my concern as regards the absence of a guarantee of appropriate access for all [[stakeholders]] to technical information and spare parts, which will in fact limit the freedom of choice of the [[dealer]] or the garage [[owner]] to whom the [[consumer]] might turn.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4584	The [[winner]] of the award earned the [[Commission's]] recognition with a report written in Hungarian, her native language.	Female,Amb
4585	As a [[citizen]] of Poland, I visited your country in 1976.	Amb
4586	It is worrying to note that the sovereign will of the [[electorate]] is not respected and that the presidential [[candidate]] who won the elections, according to Côte d'Ivoire's Independent Electoral [[Commission]], has been blocked from taking up his post by the Constitutional [[Court]].	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
4587	(DE) Mr [[President]], I am afraid that I am going to be the [[person]] to pour cold water on this.	Male,Amb
4588	The mad [[cow]] affair is unfortunately a good illustration of our drifting off course and the IGC should learn the lessons from this if it really wants to solve the problems of concern to [[citizens]].	Female,Amb
4589	A foreign [[lawyer]] who sets up in Luxembourg with his home-country professional qualification may know nothing about the languages used in that country.	Male
4590	[[I]] would like to ask the [[Commissioner]] how she intends to put pressure on Member States to make sure that water is not the expensive luxury that [[no-one]] can afford.	Amb,Female,Amb
4591	This means that the present situation, in which these national [[authorities]] are operating, will not be without a European framework, and [[we]] shall of course monitor this, Mrs [[Read]], since whenever European legislation is adopted, the [[Commission]] has to monitor the application of these laws and intervene where necessary.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
4592	Thank you, Mrs [[Green]], but [[I]] have no way of closing this debate today while [[people]] are still asking for the floor.	Female,Amb,Amb
4593	Madam [[Commissioner]], [[I]] think that answer might surprise the Spanish [[Environment Minister]], because she herself said in the Spanish Parliament that it was the European Commission which had demanded this amendment to the Spanish law, in order to regulate the exception to the prohibition on hunting [[birds]] during their breeding period.	Female,Amb,Female,Amb
4594	[[I]] hope that reply satisfies you, Mrs [[Plooij-van Gorsel]].	Amb,Female
4595	[[One]] only has to consider that in terms of [[users]], the percentage ownership of computers, particularly in rural areas, is low.	Amb,Amb
4596	These [[children]] of the world, these white Zulus, shamans of globalist rites, are converting to protectionism, discovering the benefits of national protection and calling for state sovereignty.	Amb
4597	Mr [[Ford]], [[I]] must tell you that the [[Members]] here do take Friday mornings seriously.	Male,Amb,Amb
4598	Do [[we]] think it is normal that a young Turkish [[person]] should have to apply for a visa to follow his football [[team]] on a trip to London, whilst his Spanish [[friend]] can do so without one?	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
4599	Madam [[President]], on behalf of my [[group I]] would just like to express my approval and full support for this oral amendment.	Female,Amb
4600	[[Individuals]] have a right to a fair trial, and political [[prisoners]] ought to be released.	Amb,Amb
4601	Perhaps Mrs [[Wulf-Mathies]] could tell [[us]] how long it will take for the [[Commission]] to reach a decision?	Female,Amb,Amb
4602	[[We]] have heard Portuguese [[speakers]] and a Greek [[speaker]]; in my case, as an [[Austrian]] I know that in the dark hours of our history, when we were oppressed, it was very comforting to receive signs of solidarity from other countries in the world.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4603	It is a great pity that Mr [[Virgin]] is not here today to outline his report to the House, but [[we]] certainly agree with most of the points which he expresses.	Male,Amb

4680	Mr [[President]], first of all, [[I]] should like to congratulate our [[rapporteur]] on her excellent work and also on the commendable way in which she cooperated in the [[Committee]] on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.	Male,Amb,Female,Amb
4681	[[I]] would not like the precautionary principle to lead to a repetition of what happened to a [[friend]] of mine when he went out with his [[wife]].	Amb,Male,Female
4682	[[I]] thus agree with the many [[speakers]], headed by the rapporteur Mr [[Katiforis]], who have shed light on the need for public investment in education, research, environmental improvements and the like.	Amb,Male,Male
4683	For example, will the [[opposition]] succeed in uniting behind one [[candidate]]?	Amb,Amb
4684	Madam [[President]], it was quite depressing to listen to the [[representative]] of the Council, given that she appears to believe that the Middle East conflict is being played out between equal [[parties]] whom [[we]] ought to treat equally, adopting a policy of equidistance.	Female,Female,Amb,Amb
4685	[[I]] congratulate Mrs [[Fraga Estevez]] once again on her excellent report which clearly demonstrates that, of the fisheries agreements signed by the developing countries with third countries, it is those which they sign with the European Union which achieve and guarantee a greater degree of transparency and control of fishing activities in those areas.	Amb,Female
4686	[[We]] are pleased to see the change in the attitude of the American [[government]] which, in July, withdrew from negotiations on concluding a protocol to implement the Convention, as you have just reminded us, [[Commissioner]], and we hope that the new conference that is due to take place next week in Geneva, which you informed us about, Madam [[President-in-Office]] of the Council, will consequently take place under the best possible auspices.	Amb,Amb,Female,Female
4687	Madam [[President]], Mr [[Lamy]], Mr [[Fischler]], [[I]] should like to say, first of all, that I am delighted by the success of the Doha ministerial conference, not only from the point of view of its results, but also from a material point of view.	Female,Male,Male,Amb
4688	The [[Minister]] said that he had spent a good deal of time in the last few weeks at about 30 000 feet.	Male

4690	[[Women]] have far too little power; far too few of them are at the helm of businesses, and in my country, the Netherlands, with 6% of female business [[managers]], they are worse off than anywhere else; [[we]] should hang our heads in shame.	Female,Female,Amb
4691	Mr [[Galeote Quecedo]], you were as helpful as a wet Friday in November.	Male

4693	This is my answer to Mr [[Purvis]]	Male
4694	The [[patient]] was so angry about his illness that he shot the [[doctor]], but you will understand, Mr [[President-in-Office]], that [[I]] feel rather nervous when I see that it is precisely the [[governments]] that are once again gathering around Europe’s sickbed.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
4695	[[I]] will read it carefully so that [[everybody]] knows what [[we]] are voting for: ‘Notes with satisfaction the improvements made by Romanian [[authorities]] in the area of the protection of [[children]] and urges the Romanian [[Government]] to settle the cases of applications for international adoption made during the moratorium of June 2001, ensuring that all cases are examined in light of the UN Convention on the Rights of the [[Child]] and the Romanian law on the legal status of adoption, with the goal of allowing inter-country adoptions to take place, where justified and appropriate, in those special cases’.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4696	[[We]] will also be very happy to support the [[Commissioner]] in any steps she takes to bring pressure to bear on the [[Israelis]] to meet their promise to safeguard the free movement of [[persons]], goods and information and, of course, to lend their full support to the Rafah Agreement.

4699	– It really is a serious matter when an honourable [[friend]] from Greece expresses herself in such a manner against her fellow [[Members]] in plenary.	Female,Amb
4700	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], Mr [[Prime Minister]], [[I]] am sorry but your approach is more that of a careful civil [[servant]] or an [[apprentice]] rather than a [[leader]], let alone visionary.	Male,Female,Male,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4701	(ET) [[I]] would like to greet our rapporteur Mr [[Sacconi]] and congratulate him on his good work and his cogency during the numerous negotiations.	Amb,Male

4704	Being a close [[friend]] and ally of the [[Commission]] and stretching our patience generously, [[I]] think [[we]] should give the Commission more time, if that is what it wants, but, as other [[speakers]] have said, on the condition that, in the meantime, an immediate moratorium banning all seal products in the EU is put into effect.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4705	on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would like to start by saying how very grateful I am to the [[rapporteur]] for her dedicated work on the fine report that she has put before [[us]].	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Female,Amb
4706	The [[rapporteur]], whom [[I]] would like to thank for his excellent report, refers to this problem in a number of the points he raises.	Male,Amb
4707	Today, at a meeting with the Socialist [[Group]], the [[Chancellor]] said that to her, relations with Poland are equally as important than relations with France, and misunderstandings are a thing of the past.	Amb,Female
4708	Overall, as [[Chairman]] of the [[committee]] to which our colleagues Mrs [[Lévai]], Mr [[Doorn]] and Mr [[Medina]] belong, I believe I can say that these four regulatory initiatives cover the situation comprehensively and that the [[Commission]] is duty-bound to reflect on them.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Male,Amb
4709	In addition, when going through [[passengers']] personal items [[staff]] often have no respect for basic hygienic rules.	Amb,Amb
4710	[[We]] denounce that, and we also question the [[government]] on two murders, those of a theatre [[director]] and a [[journalist]], both known to have criticised the Uzbek Government.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4711	[[I]] believe that for a [[politician]] who speaks through her work, there can be no better memorial.	Amb,Female
4712	It would be excellent if the French [[President]] could start a serious debate on sorting out the issue of Parliament's two seats: let [[us]] concentrate all activities in Brussels and avoid the monthly move to Strasbourg (where the site could be used for other purposes, such as the centre of technological excellence): this 'trip' actually represents a huge and unjustified waste of financial and energy resources.	Amb,Amb
4713	However, before long [[we]] will be discussing what to include in the curriculum, what kind of [[teacher]] training we should have and what Member States need to do, in order to 'involve young [[migrants]] in a wide range of extracurricular activities'.	Amb,Amb,Amb
4714	[[I]] would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs [[Estrela]], for her report and the effort she has put into this.	Amb,Female
4715	The International Day for the Elimination of Violence against [[Women]] is an incentive by the UN and the Council of Europe which aims to discuss and give greater visibility to the [[victims]] of domestic violence and other types of mistreatment.	Female,Female
4716	In addition, her other professional achievements, such as holding the position of Chief Adviser to the World Bank and being Spain's first female Minister for Foreign Affairs, do not leave any doubt that she will be the right [[person]] in the right job.	Female
4717	It is necessary, therefore, to monitor all misconduct by [[employers]] with regard to female [[workers]].	Amb,Female
4718	(DE) Mr [[President]], firstly, [[I]] would like to make it clear, following repeated claims in this House, that during the budget negotiations, [[we]] have not requested a single cent more than the [[Council]] had offered us.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
4719	By way of apology, [[he]] said, 'that was not my comment, it was made by your master [[Plato]]'.	Male,Amb
4720	in writing. - [[I]] would like to express my sincere gratitude to the rapporteur, [[Kinga Gál]], for her effort to open up the problem of the violation of [[human]] rights in the European Union.	Amb,Female,Amb
4721	The [[rapporteur]] tells [[us]] that the EU is very concerned indeed about human rights abuses outside the EU - but what about the forced deportations of [[Roma]] from Belgium in 1999 during the premiership of [[Guy Verhofstadt]], who now sits here as an MEP?	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4722	[[I]] am sure that he is a very committed [[politician]] and I think [[you]] can agree that, leaving aside the legal issues - which will be dealt with in an objective and impartial manner because [[we]] will treat Hungary exactly like any other Member State - we must also concern ourselves with the political aspects.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
4723	Nevertheless, Ireland's [[leader]] has spent two days in Europe, which is unprecedented - one with President [[Barroso]] and today with Chancellor [[Merkel]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
4724	Yes, [[we]] could have gone further on the traceability, taking it up to the [[patient]], but this is a battle that we would have lost and it would have delayed the directive.	Amb,Amb
4725	As a result, the actions of the former [[president]] which contravene the will of the [[nation]] should be condemned.	Amb,Amb
4726	It seems to [[me]] that there has been too little acknowledgement of the work undertaken jointly by the Union, whether in regard to the necessary aid to the [[victims]] or medical preparedness and tighter safety measures to guard against future accidents.	Amb,Amb
4727	Mr [[President]], firstly [[I]] should like to express my gratitude to the [[members]] of the Committee on Regional Policy for their cooperation in producing this report.	Male,Amb,Amb
4728	[[We]] have not had much reassurance on this either, Mr [[Commissioner]], from you or from the [[Commission]].	Amb,Male,Amb
4729	In the [[Court's]] opinion, the transactions underlying the commitments are also, taken as a whole, legal and regular, although some commitments were effected either without budgetary authorisation or without a legal base.	Amb
4730	These are the words and the conviction of the [[leader]] of the [[socialists]] in Flanders.	Amb,Amb
4731	Mrs [[McIntosh]], [[I]] fully understand your concern, and I think that it will be necessary for the [[Commission]] to propose a solution to the problem which you have rightly described.	Female,Amb,Amb
4732	As Mr [[Gil-Robles]] has said, and as [[I]] said earlier, [[we]] are now in a position where the interinstitutional agreement as regards OLAF applies to the [[Commission]], to the [[Council]] and to the [[staff]] of this institution but it does not apply to the [[Members]] of this institution.

4835	Thank you very much, Mr [[Nogueira Román]], but [[I]] could not agree with you more, for all of the reasons you have given and for one more, which explains why we are speaking almost the same language.	Male,Amb
4836	[[I]] welcome the news that I received yesterday that a class has begun at the French High School in Kabul which is open to [[women]] and where female [[students]] do not have to wear veils.	Amb,Female,Female
4837	A Danish [[official]] is deprived of her brief and is marginalised for drawing attention to instances of maladministration, by which [[I]] mean what went on at Eurostat, to which our report makes reference.	Female,Amb
4838	As the [[parent]] of a diabetic [[daughter]], can I support the honourable [[Member]] in her plea for Commission action and particularly congratulate her on the initiative that she and Mr [[Bovis]] are taking to bring this to the attention of [[Parliament]].	Amb,Female,Female,Male,Amb
4839	As [[he]] said, [[I]] have been very pleased with the way that our [[committees]] have worked together on this issue and, in particular, the cooperation with the [[rapporteur]] which has ensured that the points made by the [[Committee]] on [[Women']]s Rights have been fully taken on board.	Male,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
4840	The [[head]] of the main opposition party in the Spanish State said this recently.	Amb
4841	The appointment of the [[President]] of the Commission will follow the European elections so that these may have an influence on it, and so that [[we]] can have time to do what is necessary, by which [[I]] mean that the [[committees]] will be subjecting the [[candidates]] from the old and the new Member States to rigorous scrutiny to see if they are suited to the position.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4842	It was because all the [[members]] of the [[committee]] agreed that the [[candidate]] has the requisite training and ability to carry out the task before her.	Amb,Amb,Female
4843	In her question, the honourable [[Member]] touches on certain points on which the [[Council]] would comment as follows:	Female,Amb
4844	Mr [[President]], [[we]] have a very good report here, thanks in large part to the [[rapporteur]], who leaves us in no doubt that he understands this matter in practice as well as theory.	Male,Amb,Male
4845	Indeed, to call you a [[lawyer]] would be a compliment, since there are many [[lawyers]] who are actually working in the interests of [[families]] and their inheritance. You are only a bailiff, the man who carries out the process of seizing this social market economy, which can best be summed up as follows: the market is economising on [[society]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
4846	Mr [[Konrad]] pointed out that, ultimately, state aid often leads to loss of money without bringing any significant tangible benefits.	Male
4847	[[I]] thank the honourable [[Member]] for her addition.	Amb,Female
4848	[[I]] urge the [[Minister]] to persuade interior [[ministries]] and home offices to change the habits of a lifetime and be open, candid and accountable in their dealings.	Amb,Amb,Amb
4849	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] too congratulate the [[rapporteur]] on his excellent work, which is an obvious sign of heightened sensitivity, derived from his specific expertise in this area.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Male
4850	Thanks to this ongoing dialogue, the [[rapporteur]] has fulfilled all of the requests submitted to him.	Male
4851	Already, in the short period of time that [[I]] have been fulfilling these responsibilities, I value the relationship that I have been able to build with the [[chairman]], [[rapporteur]] and [[members]] of the Committee on Budgets, and with the [[Commissioner]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
4852	– Mr [[President]], [[Parliament]] recently voted in favour of resolutions condemning, for example, the manner in which the elections have been conducted in certain countries, such as Belarus, where it would appear that the outgoing [[candidate]] had far greater resources at his disposal than the opposition [[candidate]].	Male,Amb,Male,Amb
4853	Mr [[President]], [[I]] was 18 when I took part in one of the longest [[student]] strikes in Eastern Europe.	Male,Amb,Amb
4854	It does not fall under my sphere of responsibility, but [[I]] would be very happy to refer the issue to my [[colleague]] who is responsible for that area and see what she can make of the situation.	Amb,Female
4855	[[Member]] of the [[Commission]].	Amb,Amb
4856	Turkey had a female [[Head]] of Government 14 years ago.	Female
4857	on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Madam [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[I]] would first of all like to congratulate Mrs [[Carlotti]] on this excellent report and say that when [[we]] are talking about the implementation of the agenda, we need to look at each country case by case, the real costs that they have to bear and their management.	Female,Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
4858	There are times when [[we]] need to be quite blunt - and [[I]] am aware that some of my female [[colleagues]] have criticised me in that regard - because certain [[individuals]] who have appeared before this House in recent years have occasionally given the unmistakable impression that the European Parliament is of little interest to them.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
4859	In any event, [[we]] support Mrs [[Aubert's]] report and thank her for her work.	Amb,Female
4860	Mr [[Cramer]] will cycle, Mr [[Marinescu]] will go home on a new high-speed train, Mr [[Costa]] will use the vaporetto, Vice-President [[Tajani]] will travel by scooter in Rome and [[I]] like to travel on foot in my home town.	Male,Male,Male,Amb,Amb
4861	That is the outcome of a statement such as the one [[you]] have made: nor have you mentioned the Uighur [[people]] simply because they do not have a transnational [[leader]] supporting non-violence, such as the [[Dalai Lama]], and [[I]] believe that that is serious when [[we]] are talking about China.	Amb,Amb,Male,Male,Amb,Amb
4862	Madam [[President]], [[I]] should like to join Mr [[Bowis]] and Mr [[Maaten]] in congratulating the [[Commissioner]] on her Green Paper which is not a day, or even hour, too soon, in my view.	Female,Amb,Male,Male,Female
4863	There has been a change of style and tone since Commissioner [[Ashton]] replaced Commissioner [[Mandelson]] and now [[we]] are receiving clear signals that there is a change of substance too.	Amb,Amb,Amb
4864	[[I]] firmly believe that a [[politician]] who acts on the basis of her personal experience of motherhood and [[family]] life will best understand [[women's]] problems.	Amb,Female,Amb,Female
4865	Mr [[Füle]], the question of the return of the [[refugees]], if you will pardon my saying so, has been handled by Croatia in a way which could serve as a model for other states.	Male,Amb
4866	The report by Mr [[Mann]] clearly reveals problems to which [[we]] ought to pay greater attention.	Male,Amb
4867	[[Vice-President]] of the Commission. - Mr [[President]], please bear with me because I will try to respond to our three [[rapporteurs]] and the [[Ombudsman]].	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
4868	[[I]] had every hope in November when Commissioner [[Füle]] put the ball in Albania's court and said: no more progress until [[you]] resolve this.	Amb,Amb,Amb
4869	Our [[colleague]] has worked exceptionally hard and efficiently over the past six months, but unfortunately he is unable to attend this sitting, and [[I]] have the honour to stand in for him in today's debate.	Male,Amb
4870	A leading university [[lecturer]] recently shared his view with [[me]] that, in actual fact, Bulgarian universities are not aware that there is also an Erasmus programme for [[teachers]].	Male,Amb,Amb
4871	Mr [[President]], [[I]] should like to put two further points to the [[Commissioner]]. In the first place I should like to remind him that the amendments which the [[Committee]] on Transport has retained were mainly amendments which were originally in the [[Commission]] proposal.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
4872	Another example referred to just now by a [[colleague]] is the USSR under [[Stalin]], who, without batting an eyelid, signed a splendid Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the San Francisco Conference. Having a Gulag that contained millions of [[prisoners]] did not embarrass him in the least.	Amb,Male,Amb
4873	Mr [[Teverson]], [[I]] fully share your view.	Male,Amb
4874	A single [[institution]] will be inadequate: cooperation will be needed between different institutions, schools, training centres, [[associations]] and [[families]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
4875	[[I]] should sincerely like to thank the [[Minister]] for her enthusiastic reply.	Amb,Female
4876	Mrs [[Aelvoet]] has already mentioned an example of where things are not working.	Female
4877	But emergency resuscitation is still possible, and on this point [[I]] agree with the comments of my friend, [[Manuel Marín]]. I strongly doubt that the closure of borders, ports and airports, the withholding of tax receipts, the cutting off of what corresponds to vital oxygen for the [[patient]], is the most appropriate way of saving him.	Amb,Amb,Male
4878	Even linked to a system of payments the repair clause proposed by the [[rapporteur]] raises major objections at the level of fairness.	Amb
4879	Mr [[President]], one of the important questions was whether [[Parliament]] should express any kind of dissatisfaction with a [[judge]].	Male,Amb,Amb
4880	[[We]] must think of our own [[people]] before [[others]], even if they are our brothers.	Amb,Male,Male
4881	If the [[Member]] then returns to his native country and makes exactly the same speech, with a political content, shall he then be able to be prosecuted for this?	Male
4882	Phoning my [[assistant]] at night on her home telephone number is not my idea of responsible lobbying.	Female
4883	Mr [[President]], the [[Commissioner]] employed exclusively geographical criteria in her comments on islands.	Male,Female
4884	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] wish to begin by thanking Mrs [[Larive]] for her comprehensive and detailed motion for a resolution on the [[Commission's]] communication, as well as for her interest in our policy on commercial communications in the single market.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Female,Amb
4885	As my Swedish [[colleague]] mentioned earlier, the situation has now changed significantly.	Amb
4886	The next item is the report (A4-0175/99) by Mr [[Fayot]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the communication from the [[Commission]] 'Financial services: building a framework for action' (COM(98)0625 - C4-0688/98).	Male,Amb,Amb
4887	The decision had nothing to do with whether or not the [[artist]] was a lesbian - [[I]] do not know if she is or not - but with the fact that it was felt that the content of the exhibition would have been offensive to some [[Members]] and some of the [[people]] passing through Parliament.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
4888	Particularly in view of the incidents of the last few months and the crisis in the [[Commission]], it would, to my mind, be a severe handicap if the new [[director]] were to be appointed without EEC legislative procedure having been fully complied with.	Amb,Amb
4889	Let me spend a moment to share with [[you]] a case I had in private practice as a [[lawyer]] before I was elected to this Parliament.	Amb,Amb

5009	Madam [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], the [[Council]] shares the honourable [[Member's]] deep concern about the state of relations between the Union and the United States.	Female,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
5010	Even the [[rapporteur]] himself has already deleted a number of points on the subject of social protection and environment.	Male
5011	Mr [[Lange]] was, however, luckier than Mr [[Schulz]], because the film was a remake of ‘Gone with the Wind’, because of the resemblance between Mr Lange and [[Clark Gable]].	Male,Male,Amb
5012	The [[rapporteur]] cannot be blamed for this, as he drafted a sound report in the shortest possible time.	Male
5013	With regard to Mrs [[Oomen-Ruijten's]] question, on Amendment No 20, which asks for Member States to take due account of products registered in other Member States, our position is that the common position goes beyond that amendment because it submits these products to mutual recognition.	Female
5014	[[Benjamin Franklin]], the father of the American Constitution, was right to say that a [[person]] who is prepared to surrender his freedom to win security will lose both.	Male,Male
5015	[[We]] also propose a new budget item totalling EUR 10 million to enable us to be proactive in efficiently tackling diseases other than HIV, malaria and TB that claim many millions of lives each year, especially among [[children]].	Amb,Amb
5016	Will the [[Commissioner]] therefore finally confirm his unequivocal support for this directive and his willingness to work with [[us]] in Parliament for its speedy and smooth transition?	Male,Amb
5017	For the time being, preliminary preparations are being made for a number of additional actions and, at the same time, my colleague and Commissioner with jurisdiction, Mrs [[Fischer Boel]], is in close contact with the Spanish [[Minister]] of Agriculture.	Female,Amb
5018	In the situation of reduced quality, it becomes appealing for [[patients]] to look across the border.	Amb
5019	[[We]] must act immediately in order to respond to this threat of climate change, which is undoubtedly one of the most serious threats in the history of [[humankind]].	Amb,Amb
5020	The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0381/2005) by Mrs [[Korhola]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the common position adopted by the [[Council]] with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of the provisions of the Århus Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters to Community [[institutions]] and [[bodies]] (06273/2/2005 – C6-0297/2005 – 2003/0242(COD)).	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5021	To the [[Prime Minister’s]] cry of ‘[[they]] shall not pass’, the [[Minister]] for Industry deployed all of his ‘weapons of mass obstruction’ to the point of changing the rules of the game in the middle of the match − which incidentally had to be rectified during the stage between the [[Cabinet]] and the Official State Bulletin − turning Spain into a kind of banana republic in which legal certainty is trampled upon.	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
5022	- (LT) Madam [[Minister]], [[I]] fully agree that [[historians]] are the ones charged with evaluating history; however, they have different attitudes.	Female,Amb,Amb
5023	on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - [[Madam President]], the previous [[speaker]] has just made reference, regretfully, apparently, to lots of jobs in politics going to the stronger [[people]] - the [[men]].	Female,Amb,Male,Male
5024	Can the [[Commissioner]] elaborate - even briefly - on the practical outcomes he expects from this?	Male
5025	What [[I]] do not think the report conveys sufficiently well is the reason why [[people]], mainly young [[men]], become or are lured into becoming terrorists and place themselves outside democratic [[society]].	Amb,Male,Male,Amb
5026	on behalf of the GUE/NGL [[Group]]. - (FR) Mr [[President]], [[Prime Minister]], Madam [[Minister]], if there is an area where Sweden's experience is of interest to [[us]] when it comes to European policy, [[I]] think it is one which you unfortunately chose to overlook in your address, that is, the social field, and more specifically the lessons to be learnt from the Laval-Vaxholm case.	Amb,Male,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
5027	The report also introduces a series of proposals and suggestions for improving conditions for female [[prisoners]], in particular single [[mothers]] and young [[prisoners]].	Female,Female,Female
5028	in writing. - (PL) [[I]] voted in favour of Mrs [[Gill's]] report 'Enhancing the quality of life of older [[people]]', which aims to promote the use of modern information and communication technology as a means of support for the elderly.	Amb,Female,Amb
5029	[[Commissioner]], [[we]] have to take things in hand, we have to carry out the various studies needed so that [[no one]] can profit at the expense of the world's poorest or Europe's most disadvantaged [[citizens]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5030	on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam [[President]], Mrs [[Kosciusko-Morizet]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] too wish to salute the work done by our [[colleague]] and the determination she has shown in dealing with this dossier.	Female,Female,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Female
5031	[[I]] would also like to start by apologising that the Spanish [[Minister]] for [[Equality]] is not here, as she has just attended a vote in the Spanish [[Senate]] on the reform of the abortion law, which, incidentally, had a good outcome, as it has just been adopted this afternoon in the Spanish [[Parliament]].	Amb,Female,Female,Amb,Amb
5032	[[I]] would like to hear from [[him]] whether his colleague, [[Angela Merkel]], used such damning words about Russia during her recent meeting with Mr [[Putin]].	Amb,Male,Female,Male
5033	The European [[Consumer]] Centre in Austria has published an up-to-date analysis, which indicates that the world's leading and most prominent textile [[businesses]] are unable to guarantee that raw materials from state-sponsored [[companies]] involving [[child]] labour are not used in their production.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5034	[[I]] have voted in favour of the report by Mr [[Papastamkos]] on EU agriculture and international trade.	Amb,Male
5035	[[They]] deserve our full commitment and it is incredibly important for the international [[community]] to help in matters relating to [[human]] rights quickly, efficiently and in a targeted way.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5036	[[I]] have a final remark on the economy. Some [[people]] fear this work is about dismantling the welfare states and social protection.	Amb,Amb
5037	(SK) Madam [[President]], [[I]] do not want to point fingers, but I think that the failure of the conciliation procedure is a setback and [[we]] have thrown out the [[baby]] with the bathwater.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
5038	[[I]] believe [[we]] have all found her to be a very competent [[person]].	Amb,Amb,Female
5039	Firstly, Mrs [[Figueiredo]], in relation to issues of global financial regulation, as you know, since the G20 was established as the principal economic forum for global governance in financial matters, it is the G20 that is given precedence on these issues.	Female
5040	[[I]] would also like to underline the point made by the [[rapporteur]] that what [[we]] need here is political will and in the process thank the rapporteur, Mr [[Sindal]], for the political will he has demonstrated throughout [[Parliament's]] consideration of this communication.	Amb,Male,Amb,Male,Amb
5041	[[I]] am glad that the [[Minister]] has now given assurances that it will be dealt with speedily and perhaps in view of the exchanges that [[we]] heard just now, the relevant Minister for Justice could appear before this House to give her personal assurances on the issue before December.	Amb,Female,Amb
5042	That is immediately clear if [[you]] consider how impossible it is for the [[courts]] to prosecute [[criminals]] who move to another Member State; in such cases they are able to act only by means of letters of request - a lengthy and impracticable process which leaves the [[person]] under investigation plenty of time to regularize his situation.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male
5043	The first speaker is Mrs [[Green]], on behalf of the PSE Group.	Female
5044	We on the Committee of Inquiry know something about this - a British [[minister]] felt that we were not worthy to meet with him.	Male
5045	[[I]] would agree in principle with the honourable [[Member]] - and I think this reflects the views of the [[Council]] as a whole - when he says that if [[we]] wish to promote democracy and human development in Cuba, then isolating and boycotting it as the American [[administration]] has done since 1959 is no longer an appropriate means of doing so, especially now that Cuba is no longer a threat to the national security of the United States.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
5046	However, [[I]] have some sympathy with Mr [[Virgin]].	Amb,Male
5047	[[I]] say this with the best of intentions, for the benefit of Mrs [[Green]].	Amb,Female
5048	Quite rightly [[he]] is stressing the amount of effort the [[Commission]], and in particular his [[directorate]], are putting into ensuring that directives and regulations agreed by Member States are transposed by those Member States.	Male,Amb,Amb
5049	[[I]] think it is rare, Mr [[President]], to echo the bold statement of the previous [[speaker]], that a [[leader]] is democratically elected with the enthusiasm of all the [[people]], and particularly rare in Africa.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
5050	However, Mrs [[Ainardi]], [[I]] must tell you that, in relation to 1980, the European aerospace industry is now much more oriented towards the civil side.	Female,Amb
5051	In my view, it contains no definite proposal on guaranteed freedom of speech, and [[I]] believe that Mrs [[Lööw]] agrees with me on this.	Amb,Female
5052	[[We]] supported the Liberal [[Group's]] proposal for [[Commissioners]] to be individually accountable, with the call for the departure of Commissioners [[Marín]] and [[Cresson]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5053	Rigorous and realistic policies are now called for, as is suggested in the Fourçans report, on which [[I]] congratulate our [[colleague]].	Amb,Amb
5054	In some countries, things have been permitted because it has not been proved that a very small amount of pesticides in [[baby]] food is harmful, whereas other countries do not tolerate any pesticide residues at all.	Amb
5055	My third remark concerns a matter frequently raised in this House and one which [[I]] believe is in the thoughts of all [[Members]] of Parliament.	Amb,Amb
5056	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to thank the [[rapporteur]] for his excellent report.	Male,Amb,Male

Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
5136	Above all, however, my vote for the motion is an invitation to consider reducing not just the working time in a [[worker' s]] day but the time he spends working over his entire lifetime. It would, in fact, be appropriate for a [[person]] not to have to work for 80 years if he is going to live to be 90 years of age, but to work for a period of 30 years if he is going to live to be 60 or 70.	Male,Male
5137	However, the [[rapporteur]] goes even further in supporting the [[Commission' s]] recommendations.	Amb,Amb

5139	Nor did high-level sport produce dozens of cases of rape and sexual attacks in the Olympic village in Atlanta; and French tennis champion, [[Nathalie Tauziat]], who wrote a book criticising the very emotionally charged atmosphere behind the scenes of the tennis courts, was obviously eliminated from the French [[team]] selection in Sydney in the name of the team spirit and significant social values fostered by sport, according to Mr [[Mennea]], the rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.	Amb,Amb,Male
5140	[[I]] took some persuading that a directive such as this was necessary at all.	Amb
5141	If Mr [[Harbour]] does not feel that this is important for economic development in Europe, [[I]] really do not know what he feels is important.	Male,Amb
5142	If [[I]] asked any [[member]] of the public: 'Would you be prepared to pay more for [[animal]] welfare?', naturally he is going to say: 'Of course I would!'	Amb,Male,Amb
5143	She proved to be an excellent [[partner]] in those negotiations.	Female
5144	This also covers the issue whereby a [[person]] must have the right to return to the same job, or at least a similar one, and with the same terms and conditions of employment, after a period of maternity leave, for example.	Female
5145	[[I]] think that a good relationship was maintained between all [[those]] involved, and I also believe that all of the proposals tabled by the [[Committee]] on [[Citizens]]' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs have been taken into consideration by the [[Committee]] on Constitutional Affairs.

5151	The honourable [[Member]] may recall that the UNDP, under the direction of their distinguished regional [[director]] who is, as it happens, a woman, has drawn up a report trying to answer the question of why Arab League countries have not prospered as much as other comparable societies.	Amb,Female
5152	In an earlier intervention, the [[rapporteur]] said that the European Union's transport policy was still lacking in one respect: he thought that [[we]] had lost the battle for sustainability.	Male,Amb
5153	[[I]] now turn to the report by Mrs [[Patrie]].	Amb,Female
5154	The oral question refers to points which have already been illustrated by both Mrs [[Iivari]] and Mrs [[Pack]], in other words the fact that [[we]] in the [[Committee]] on Culture have often realised that many of the measures debated subsequently by the [[Council]] are developed according to a coordination method from which we are excluded.	Female,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
5155	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would like to take the floor to protest against the abuse levelled at the European Union by the Cuban dictator [[Fidel Castro]] during a rally a very short time ago.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
5156	Certainly, this exclusion gratifies the Spanish nationalism of Mr [[Gil-Robles]], but does not match in any way with what Mr [[Tsatsos]] wrote after the Treaty of Nice: 'The EU must steer a cause between the opposite poles of effectiveness and legitimacy, a balance which takes account of its raison d'être as Union of [[peoples]] and states'.	Male,Male,Amb
5157	What did [[I]] see Mr [[President]]?	Amb,Male
5158	I think I am the last [[speaker]] from Parliament before the [[rapporteur]] and the [[Commission]] and I just want to make three fundamental points.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5159	The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe naturally condemns all types of violence and calls upon the Iraqi [[authority]] to ensure that legal proceedings are taken against the [[people]] responsible.	Amb,Amb
5160	The next item is the statement by the [[President]] of the Commission on the Commission’s strategic political orientations.	Amb
5161	[[We]] are just coming up to Alpe d’Huez, and [[I]] think [[you]] should bear in mind that the [[winner]] of the Tour gets to wear the only if he makes it through the whole distance and wins every stage.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male
5162	[[I]] would ask, [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], that we observe a minute’s silence in memory of our [[colleague]].	Amb,Female,Male,Amb
5163	[[I]] would first of all like to thank the [[rapporteur]] for continuing in the second reading to fight for strict regulation that takes human and environmental assets and interests into account.	Amb,Amb
5164	A [[child]] who has suffered the horrors of pornography and paedophilia should not be helped only when she cooperates with the [[police]] and reveals the names of her [[exploiters]], but requires constant, life-long assistance, because the consequences of the harm she has suffered will probably mark her forever.	Female,Amb,Amb
5165	In Norway, the [[government]] has passed a law requiring 40% of supervisory [[board]] [[members]] in quoted companies to be [[women]].	Amb,Amb,Female,Female
5166	(Mr [[President]], it is very important that the report drafted by Mr [[Elmar Brok]] has today provided [[us]] with the opportunity to speak about enlargement.	Male,Male,Amb
5167	[[I]] suspect that [[they]] also present the [[Commission]] with certain difficulties, if not only because of the tensions which naturally exist between DG Development’s concerns and priorities and DG Trade’s concerns and priorities, which are very different.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5168	[[I]] would also like to underscore what Mrs [[Harkin]] has said, namely that the key competence is learning to learn rather than wait for encyclopaedic knowledge to be acquired in school; being able to handle information, experience and an environment which are increasingly more complex and more global.	Amb,Female
5169	I wish in particular to thank my esteemed colleagues and coordinators, Mrs [[Pack]] and Mrs [[Prets]], because, being a member of the smallest [[group]], I would not have been able to produce this report without your support.	Female,Female,Amb
5170	on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], a moment ago [[I]] was saying to the rapporteur, Mrs [[Wortmann-Kool]], that, so far tonight, all of the [[speakers]] in this debate have been women.	Male,Amb,Amb,Female,Female
5171	That is why [[I]] am repeating my call to Mr [[Erdogan]] from this Chamber.	Amb,Male
5172	[[rapporteur]]. - Mr [[President]], just a little bit of respect for a rapporteur from my [[colleagues]] would be appreciated!	Amb,Male,Amb
5173	(EL) Madam [[President]], [[I]] would like to specifically ask the [[representative]] of the Council on the free market and free competition with regard to these products and the obstacles that may arise from this directive, which prohibits certain products that are hazardous to [[children]].	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
5174	If [[we]] do not, the future will be very bleak, and [[I]] would just like to say, Mr [[President]], that this House should send a very special greeting to the Nobel Prize [[winner]] for her very judicious words.	Amb,Amb,Male,Female
5175	There, as [[you]] know, [[we]] are preparing the multi-annual framework which we are discussing in close cooperation with Mr [[Cashman]], and we take the view that the [[Agency's]] multi-annual planning framework will provide us with useful instruments for our common action to prevent extremism.	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
5176	Statistics on female [[prisoners]] suggest a generally low level of education and a lack of vocational skills.	Female
5177	Prison remains orientated towards the needs of male [[prisoners]] and [[I]] welcome the report's aim to highlight the differences experienced by [[women]].	Male,Amb,Female
5178	There are no practical measures and it is unclear what contribution the [[players]] - ship-owners, for example - are making towards combating climate change and how they can exist in the competition that they have to bear globally.	Amb
5179	One point four million [[victims]] have still not received any help.	Amb
5180	[[I]] should point out that the combined effort of the Afghan [[authorities]] and the international [[community]] has produced some impressive results that should be highlighted: 25% decline in the [[infant]] mortality rate and 6 million [[children]] attending school, a third of whom are [[girls]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Female
5181	- The next item is the oral question to the [[Commission]] by Mr [[Visser]], Mr [[Belet]] and Mrs [[Hieronymi]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on Culture and Education, on the revision of the broadcasting communication - State aid for public broadcasting - B6-0495/2008).	Amb,Male,Male,Female,Amb
5182	Regarding the comments by Mrs [[Grabowska]]: yes, [[we]] remember what it means to be in the waiting room.	Female,Amb
5183	This is about accountability to the [[citizen]], because it concerns very important decisions.	Amb
5184	In fact, [[I]] did not hear the [[High Representative]] mention those concerns in her statement to this [[House]].	Amb,Female,Amb
5185	[[author]]. - Mr [[President]], I would just like to draw your attention to the fact that Amendment 20 to paragraph 35 is withdrawn.	Amb,Male
5186	[[President]] of the [[Commission]]. - There are two questions there.	Amb,Amb
5187	[[I]] repeat, Mr [[Speroni]], Mrs [[Ferreira]], the action was immediate.	Amb,Male,Female
5188	I have also been the [[head]] of a [[government]], and I understand the difficult situation which exists, today, in Greece.	Amb,Amb
5189	The [[Union]] must indeed develop more clout, it must be able to act in a decisive manner and to become a real pole of influence and power in this multipolar world.	Amb
5190	Following the Extraordinary Council of Energy [[Ministers]] on 21 March, the Hungarian National Development Minister, [[Tamás Fellegi]], has written to brief President [[Van Rompuy]] on the proposal for stress tests for nuclear power plants and for other countries, particularly our [[neighbours]], to be associated with this exercise.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5191	The [[Commissioner]] said that he hoped it would be good enough, but [[I]] have to say to the Commissioner that 'hope' is not enough.	Male,Amb
5192	Yet these [[doctors]] and [[nurses]] had simply treated injured [[protestors]] who were brought to their hospitals.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5193	As regards this recommendation from the rapporteur of the Committee on the Environment, Mr [[Virgin]], it need only be said that, last year and in January this year, the rapporteur made thorough, strenuous and commendable efforts to bring the [[Commission]] into line with the European Parliament on the issue of the supervision and control of shipments of hazardous waste within, into and out of the territory of the Member States.	Male,Amb
5194	Madam [[President]], in [[committee]] my [[Group]] was unable to endorse the unanimous recommendation that Mr [[Duisenberg]] be selected to head the European Monetary Institute.	Female,Amb,Amb,Male
5195	It seemed like a fantasy to [[me]] - and not a heroic one, either - and this saddens me because I regard her as a [[friend]]. She has an astute mind but I do not know what she was referring to.	Amb,Female
5196	Mr [[President]], [[I]] do not know whether it was a coincidence, but almost all the [[speakers]] on this issue so far have been women.	Male,Amb,Female
5197	[[I]] have little doubt that Mrs [[Theato]] will see that will happen.	Amb,Female
5198	It is as much in the interests of the [[buyer]] as of the [[artist]] to ensure that there is diversity of [[players]] and that there is true competition.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5199	This is why [[I]] am so pleased that a large number of our amendments have been adopted by the [[rapporteur]] and his [[committee]].	Amb,Male,Amb
5200	With this in mind, [[I]] wish you, Mr [[Minister]], Mr [[Commissioner]], every success in the forthcoming European Union - United States Summit.	Amb,Male,Male
5201	[[I]] am not in a position to announce a final outcome yet but I can assure the honourable [[Member]] that all the points she has raised have been taken very fully into consideration.	Amb,Female
5202	As [[rapporteur]] of this proposal, I would like to say that I have endeavoured to get this put back a little, but the fact is that British Presidency wants the matter settled in May, and the [[Commission]] did not want it to be postponed.	Amb,Amb
5203	[[I]] give notice that if a [[candidate]] is presented to [[us]] next week who cannot give a commitment to serve a full eight-year term, then there will be a question mark over whether or not my [[group]] would wish to support that nomination.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5204	Our political [[group]] recognizes the importance of the overall consideration which has been given to this important topic and congratulates the rapporteur, Mr [[Pex]], on the work which has been accomplished.	Amb,Male
5205	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], this proposal attempts to improve the control system for the common fisheries policy, with a view to making it more responsible and to conserving stocks.	Male,Amb,Female,Male
5206	Her attempt to trivialise accusations of fraud and to portray herself as the '[[victim]]' of 'conspiracies' originating in Germany is laughable.	Female
5207	As Mrs [[Jackson]] remarked, there has been much disruption due to the weather today, so [[we]] must get by without Mr [[Virgin]].	Female,Amb,Male
5208	Madam [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], many speeches on asylum and [[refugees]] in Europe remind [[me]] of [[Bertold Brecht's]] famous play 'The Good Woman of Szechuan', in which the main [[character]] has to work hard at night as a realist to put right the damage she has done as a philanthropist during the day.	Female,Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
5209	It is not because she is a [[woman]] that the female [[worker]] in the textile industry is in a sorry situation, it is because she is working class.	Female,Female
5210	Mr [[Anastassopoulos]] referred to a [[representative]] from a country in Eastern Europe, and [[I]] remember him saying to me: 'Mrs [[Palacio]], you require [[us]] to incorporate the acquis communautaire , but you are constantly changing it'.	Male,Female,Amb,Female,Amb
5211	[[I]] hope that, however [[we]] may vote, we each have a proper sense of our own dignity and take pride in the fact that a statute will be helpful and useful if it enables every [[representative]] of the [[people]] to enjoy real independence and freedom.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb

5326	Following on from that, [[I]] think the reason my [[colleague]] said what she did was because the UK Presidency seems to view this as a security and stability issue rather than a human rights issue.	Amb,Female
5327	Madam [[President]], [[I]] too would like to add my voice to [[those]] who have thanked Mrs [[Gebhardt]] and Mrs [[Van Lancker]] for their considerable work on this.	Female,Amb,Amb,Female,Female

Male,Amb
5332	[[author]]. - (PL) Mr [[President]], much has been said in this House concerning the situation in Uzbekistan.	Amb,Male
5333	(NL) Mr [[President]], [[I]] should like to join in the congratulations to the [[rapporteur]] on his excellent report, and I am pleased that other political [[groups]] are backing it too.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb
5334	My question for [[you]] is that, in his question, Mr [[Schlyter]] says that nanotechnology involves increasing risks.	Amb,Male
5335	If [[one]] looks at why a judgment given in one particular country can be enforced in another with regard to the criminal and penal sentences, one appreciates that, basically, what [[we]] are doing is making life for the [[person]] who has been convicted a better one: being closer, perhaps, to his [[family]], being closer, perhaps, to his place of origin.	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
5336	[[We]] should remember the biblical story of the seven fat [[cows]] and seven thin [[cows]]: thousands of years ago [[society]] was already capable of organising agricultural markets and thereby preventing fluctuations of these markets and giving Egypt the conditions for prosperity, while other [[societies]] suffered famine and wars because of the lack of food.	Amb,Female,Female,Amb,Amb
5337	on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) [[Madam President]], [[Commissioner]], Mrs [[Carlotti]], [[I]] would first of all like to congratulate you for the excellent work carried out in drafting this report, which was expertly done.	Female,Amb,Female,Amb
5338	The Italian [[Government]] and the Interior [[Minister]] should, however, have looked for other means, fully in line with European standards, and informed the European [[Commission]] beforehand rather than late in the day.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5339	[[I]] planned to abstain, and to call on my [[comrades]] to abstain, in the plenary vote as well, but my wise and tolerant female [[colleagues]] convinced me that this would not be a good idea and that a watered-down report is better than nothing.	Amb,Amb,Female
5340	[[I]] should therefore like to encourage the [[Commissioner]] not to leave matters at that, and to take the initiative once more, the right of initiative he has in the next few years to abolish this restriction of cabotage yet.	Amb,Male
5341	Mr [[President]], [[no one]] underestimates the enormous difficulties of creating the balance mentioned by the [[chair]] of our [[committee]], and of the migration pressures which face the European Union and the pressures that [[we]] face in the Mediterranean.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5342	Violence against [[women]] is certainly a problem, but [[we]] are also having the problem, as male fellow [[Members]] are often saying, that [[men]] are being affected by violence too.	Female,Amb,Male,Male
5343	The [[decision makers]] in the European Union need to have quick reflexes, to act when needed, because if Mrs [[Merkel]] had decided in time and if the European Union had taken the measures it needed to take, [[we]] would have saved a lot of money for the [[citizens]] of Europe.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb

5346	Mr [[President]], firstly [[I]] would like to convey a very warm and hearty welcome to the Irish [[Minister]] for European Affairs on this, his first visit to a plenary session of the European Parliament.	Male,Amb,Male
5347	Volkswagen in Germany is just one example; our CDU [[colleague]] is mistaken in thinking that there are no others.	Amb
5348	This is the second time this week that a Dutch [[minister]] is obvious by his absence.	Male
5349	Secondly, it distresses [[me]] to agree with Mr [[White]] in the context of the British general election, but it seems to me that the only [[people]] approaching this issue with any urgency at all are [[Members]] of the European Parliament and [[members]] of outside pressure [[groups]].	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5350	That contradiction, however, is a false contradiction and is part of the effort, despite all that Mr [[Santer]] told [[us]] yesterday, to cut resources from the European Union and the budget for agriculture, to make that money available for enlargement.	Male,Amb
5351	Public social and health services also guarantee accessibility for [[all]], including [[those]] in sparsely-populated areas, which do not represent an attractive market to the social services [[entrepreneur]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
5352	[[Parliament]] has asked the [[Commission]] to institute proceedings in the European Court of Justice on account of the failure of Mr [[Hogg]], UK Minister of Agriculture, to appear before the [[Committee]] of Inquiry on the basis of the interinstitutional decision of 19 April 1995.	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
5353	Although it is negative, it is at least clearer than the two previous answers, so [[I]] thank the [[Commissioner]] for that.	Amb,Amb
5354	From this angle - if [[you]] will permit - [[those]] who abused our [[government]] were twice mistaken, but above all made a grave error: that of demonstrating that this Europe of exposed nerves, of ugly conscience is alive in their [[person]] and in their behaviour.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5355	[[I]] think all of [[us]] in the United Kingdom know [[friends]] who have retired to Spain or to Ireland.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5356	Mr [[President]], [[I]] do not propose to speak on this sad event - which naturally grieves me as well - but I regret that I have to report to my fellow [[Members]] in this House, particularly the [[ladies]], the death, in this case from natural causes, of [[Carmen Llorca Vilaplan]], who was a Member of this House for many years and worked hard here, especially in the fields of culture and [[women's]] rights.	Male,Amb,Female,Female,Amb,Female
5357	Since your [[colleague]] has conveyed her request to [[you]], ask her also to pass on to you the written reply [[I]] sent her. Ask her to give you all the relevant information.	Female,Amb,Amb
5358	However, there was one point on which [[I]] did not agree with the [[rapporteur]], but which my [[group]] considers to be very important along with [[worker]] participation, and that is the point about best available technology.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb

5444	Any change to the educational system calls into question the ideology of the [[society]] and its economic development.	Amb
5445	Mr [[President-in-Office]] of the Council, [[we]] in Parliament have tried in vain to urge Mr [[Nielson]], the Commissioner responsible for humanitarian matters, to visit Chechnya, not just for the sake of an official visit but to carry out a serious survey of the humanitarian situation.	Male,Amb,Male
5446	The basis on which the selection was made, as [[I]] said earlier, involved no criticism of, or disrespect for, the high qualifications of the woman [[candidate]] who came before [[us]]; it related, as I said, to the fact that the candidate chosen had a profile more particularly suited to the tasks of the post in question.	Amb,Female,Amb
5447	Currently, 90% of the [[members]] of the specialist negotiating [[groups]] and of the European works councils are men.	Male,Amb
5448	The European Parliament, as the rapporteur, Mrs [[Figueiredo]] has just said, had high hopes of this Community programme.	Female
5449	To refuse [[them]] the freedom to do this would reveal the true nature of this so-called 'desire for transparency' , meaning that an [[MEP]] is above the laws that apply to all [[citizens]] in his country.	Amb,Male,Amb
5450	What do [[we]] do when we meet the Moldovan [[Minister]] of Foreign Affairs, as we did in February?	Amb,Amb
5451	[[We]] must therefore carefully weigh up every word uttered by [[anybody]], and not only one [[person]], because sometimes we find, in certain phrases which we do not analyse in depth, thoughts which may have significant consequences for the solution of the problem and there is no doubt that the problem of the [[refugees]] will continue to be a fundamental problem in terms of a solution.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5452	In conclusion, [[I]] would like again to thank the [[rapporteur]] and [[Members]] of [[Parliament]] for broadly supporting the policy initiated by the [[Commission]] which protects public health while taking proper account of [[animal]] health, animal welfare and agricultural production needs.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5453	The notion of a double key, involving double weighting of the vote, is not in line with the clause either. This is because according to legislation currently in force, every [[Member]] of the [[Council]] must have a voting right.	Amb,Amb
5454	[[I]] invite [[you]] to rise and observe a minute's silence in memory of our departed [[colleague]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
5455	[[You]] should be in no doubt that you have the support of all parliamentary [[groups]], including [[mine]], of course, for all the measures and positions that you have announced for the forthcoming discussions in the World Trade Organisation.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5456	The next item is the report (A5-0331/2003) by Mrs [[Figueiredo]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on Fisheries, on the [[Commission]] communication ‘Towards uniform and effective implementation of the common fisheries policy’ [COM(2003) 130 – 2003/2104(INI)].	Female,Amb,Amb
5457	– Mr [[Elles]], [[I]] share your view about the presence of [[Members]], but unfortunately the [[President]] cannot run Parliament like a regiment of [[soldiers]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5458	Mrs [[Junker]] has mentioned several problems, as have other [[Members]].	Female,Amb
5459	Therefore, Mr [[Poettering]], it makes no sense to issue vetoes prematurely.	Male
5460	Mr [[Miller]] mentioned the problem of Railtrack in the United Kingdom.	Male
5461	It is not only that [[he]] is prepared to implement his reactionary prejudices against [[women]] and gay [[people]] in public policy – and what signal is he sending to his eight female [[colleagues]]? – he also has a very poor record on asylum and immigration, security and the rule of law.	Male,Female,Amb,Female
5462	It will now be necessary for [[us]] to remain on our guard, given that Mrs [[Kroes]] will be responsible for competition and Mrs [[Fischer Boel]] for agriculture, meaning that there is a serious risk that conflicts of interest might arise within the European Commission, and given that Mr [[Frattini]], Mr [[Berlusconi’s]] ambassador for justice and freedom, will also be a member of this Commission.	Amb,Female,Female,Male,Male
5463	Ever since the latter was established, its [[Director]] has been appointed by the Administrative [[Board]], on the basis of a recommendation from the [[Commission]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
5464	I would like to add to what has been said by the [[Commissioner]] that [[we]] should probably add your blog, which I read on the Internet and of which I am a great [[fan]], to what has been listed here.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5465	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], as others of my fellow [[Members]] have done, [[I]] too should like to thank my friend and colleague Mr [[Kreissl-Dörfler]] for the serious work he has performed and for the difficult attempt to put together a report on which [[we]] can all agree.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
5466	The initial voluntary quotas on exports to the United States bought from the [[Japanese]] by President [[Nixon]] in exchange for the return of Okinawa to Japanese rule, later extended to Europe, led to a situation where unmet demand allowed Japanese [[corporations]] to make super-profits which, reinvested, exacerbated the problems in the long term.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5467	Mr [[President]], [[Minister]], the British [[Government]] has indicated that it is in favour of reducing the CAP and lowering agricultural subsidies, and [[I]] would therefore like to ask the [[Presidency-in-Office]] of the Council whether it believes that young [[people]] living in rural and mountain regions are going to be able to integrate better into their natural environment and whether they will have more life opportunities as a result of this proposal to abandon the common agricultural policy.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5468	[[We]] therefore call on the [[Commission]] to carry out an investigation into these allegations as, [[I]] might add, you recently pledged to do in front of the press, Mr [[Frattini]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male
5469	[[I]] then called the [[reporter]] and told him I wanted to meet the [[mullahs]].	Amb,Male,Amb
5470	Mr [[President]], [[Minister]], the second part of my question was completely ignored.	Male,Amb
5471	Parliament will never obtain integrated [[committees]], half of whose committee [[draftsmen]] or [[chairmen]] are women, until half the [[Members]] of the European Parliament are women.	Amb,Male,Male,Female
5472	Besides, it is far easier to analyse a plenary debate if the [[researcher]] can enter a term, be it 'pesticides' or 'CO2', and be directed immediately to a debate on the matter in question.	Amb
5473	[[She]] conveyed to [[me]], as I am now conveying to [[you]], to Parliament and the Commission, to the European institutions, the need for the Union to play a fundamental role in supporting the mediation by both [[Hugo Chávez]], the President of Venezuela, and of President [[Sarkozy]] of France.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5474	[[I]] thought that Ms [[Mann's]] understanding of the dilemmas that [[we]] face in this policy area was very realistic.	Amb,Female,Amb
5475	The problem with this issue about collective redress is that our [[colleagues]] in the Socialist Group seem to have already jumped to a conclusion that they want some new European legislation.	Amb
5476	Unfortunately, the statistics still indicate that 95% of [[victims]] are women.	Female
5477	The [[managers]] of these funds have to keep to legislation and standards which enable the provision of services in the territory of Member States, and supervision of financial markets has to be accurate and effective.	Amb
5478	[[We]] did not, of course, as has been pointed out, know the names of the [[candidates]] and we did not have a female [[candidate]], although, in fairness to Commissioner [[Barnier]], he explained that adequately.	Amb,Amb,Female,Male
5479	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like, firstly, to totally agree with the comments of one of the previous speakers, Mr [[Fox]], in commending the [[Commissioner]] for doing away with and banning, once and for all, the scandalous practice of discards.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb
5480	Given that domestic work accounts for between 5% and 9% of all employment; that the vast majority of the [[people]] employed in that sector are women; that such work is undervalued, underpaid and informal; and that domestic workers' vulnerability means they are often discriminated against and can easily be subjected to unequal, unfair or abusive treatment, solutions must be found to eliminate this type of situation.	Female
5481	The EU cannot forget its role in every respect as a leading [[actor]] on the world stage.	Amb
5482	Although the vote on appointing certain European [[oligarchs]] is, according to regulation, a secret ballot, [[I]] am keen to let it be known that I voted against Mr [[Draghi]],. because there is really something deeply unhealthy and perverse, in the middle of the sovereign debt crisis, about appointing a former European [[director]] of Goldman Sachs.

5557	The fact is that these texts merely present the history of Italy, of the Second World War, of nazism and fascism, on the assumption that it is clear that the values for which the [[resistance]] and the [[antifascists]] were fighting and the ideas motivating [[Hitler]] and [[Mussolini]] cannot be regarded as equal.

5563	My report has been drawn up in my capacity as [[chairman]] of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs and I am pleased to say that it has enjoyed a wide consensus in that committee.	Male
5564	Because one of [[them]] renounced exile precisely because she was a representative of her [[people]], and the [[other]] does not want to be released on health grounds because she is not the only one in prison and she represents a Kurdish [[minority]]; other [[militants]] are in prison too and she does not want the freedom which her [[captors]] are prepared to give her, or which she is said to have been offered because of her health.	Female,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb

5568	Will the [[Commissioner]] confirm that she will apply this argument to the Commission's own aid to business?	Female
5569	The [[Council]] was delighted at the fact that the new Spanish Foreign Minister, Mrs [[Palacio]], who had just come to the Council from Parliament, had met her Moroccan opposite number in Rabat immediately after the episode and that they had confirmed the desire to return to the earlier status quo.	Amb,Female
5570	It was [[Saddam Hussein]] who forced [[them]] to take it.	Amb,Amb
5571	Today, [[SMEs]] and large [[multinationals]] must realise that their success depends on responsible behaviour, in terms of the environment and respect for fundamental rights and in terms of promoting social cohesion.	Amb,Amb
5572	The multidisciplinary breast centres shall bring together [[radiologists]], [[oncologists]], [[pathologists]], [[psychologists]] and [[surgeons]], who will consult with the [[patient]] on the best method of treatment for her.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
5573	In this context, [[I]] agree with the [[rapporteur]] when she states that organic [[farmers]], who are the main actors involved in this form of production, must play an active role in this process of amending regulations.	Amb,Female,Amb
5574	No doubt reconciling the egos of so many aged male [[leaders]] is going to prove quite a challenge; increasing public opposition to the Constitution will not help either.	Male
5575	The same applies to your [[dentist]], your [[nurse]], your [[pharmacist]] and to other professions, too, such as the [[architect]] who has built your house.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5576	With regard to the [[rapporteur's]] question regarding voting, ten [[co-rapporteurs]] will speak in today's debate; the [[spokesmen]] for the [[groups]] will speak; there will contributions from the [[Council]] and the [[Commission]]; 37 [[colleagues]] will also contribute.	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5577	Mr [[President]], [[I]] should like to thank the [[rapporteur]] for her excellent report; it is now up to you, Commissioner [[Potočnik]], and your fellow [[Commissioners]] to ensure that the research priorities are implemented.	Male,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
5578	Madam [[Commissioner]], when [[we]] go to the Hong Kong Round, in my view you are slightly mistaken to think that reforming the sugar industry will give us a strong position in Europe.	Female,Amb
5579	All too often, Europe has fallen into the trap of sounding patronising and appearing to dictate to [[them]] when this is not the right partnership approach at all.	Amb
5580	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to echo the comments that have already been made by several other [[Members]] in support of the position of Mrs [[Scheele]], the rapporteur, in her report.	Male,Amb,Amb,Female
5581	Mr [[President]], the political agreement reached by the Agriculture [[Ministers]] − including the Spanish Socialist [[Minister]], for which [[she]] should have been dismissed − will undoubtedly be adopted at the end of the month among points A of the agenda, that is to say without any debate whatsoever.	Male,Amb,Female,Female
5582	[[I]] should have liked to hear Mr [[Gahler]] out, as what he was saying was most fascinating.	Amb,Male
5583	In the spirit of the founding [[fathers]] who created a Europe based on peace, it is up to [[us]] today to contribute to a Europe based on social peace.	Male,Amb
5584	The main aim of this report is for each Member State to produce a national [[Eel]] Management Plan for each and every river basin, and precisely the fact that the report covers each and every river basin is very important.	Amb
5585	– Mr [[President]], [[I]] wish first to thank Mr [[Böge]] for his excellent effort; however the agreement achieved on the package of the financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013 between the three institutions of the European Union is, for us as a [[group]], unacceptable.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb
5586	My honourable [[friends]] have already referred to corruption, to problems in relation to the freedom of the press and to the way in which electoral rolls and so forth are prepared.	Amb
5587	As for you, Madam [[Chancellor]], you are, for a Frenchman like me, the Chancellor who came from over the wall, over what is now a tourist trail and was once a barrier, while you, Mr [[Barroso]], are the President of recovered liberty, who has changed since the age of 18, when, politically speaking, you were a bit red around the edges.	Female,Male
5588	In the UN special [[rapporteur's]] report, the following must also be emphasised: 'Newspapers carry almost daily reports of senior military [[officials]] urging that such [[groups]] be neutralised and calling upon the [[populace]] to recognise that to support their [[candidates]] in the upcoming elections would be to support the [[enemy]].'	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5589	For some of [[us]], female and male, these constitute a necessary instrument, and thus we feel the point must be made that the European Union ought to follow the Norwegian example of applying measures to increase the numbers of female board [[members]] of public utilities to at least 40%, and use regulations to impose a 40% quota of female representation on boards of private companies.	Amb,Female
5590	The [[speaker]] is from the opposition.	Amb
5591	Nonetheless, one thing is true: every responsible [[politician]], every [[man]] or [[woman]] who is leading a [[government]] and wants to solve problems on his or her own country's territory through force of arms places themselves outside international law, and that applies to Mr [[Saakashvili]].	Amb,Male,Female,Amb,Male
5592	In the Scandinavian countries more than half the [[members]] of their governments are women.	Female
5593	Will [[you]] encourage the new High Representative and, when she is confirmed, Vice-President of the Commission, [[Cathy Ashton]], to make Bosnia an absolutely top priority?	Amb,Female
5594	[[I]] was in contact with [[ministers]].	Amb,Amb
5595	[[We]] must do all we can to contribute to dignified living conditions for potential [[victims]] of this crime, who tend to be people living on the margins of society.	Amb,Amb
5596	At the same time, it strengthens the areas of prevention and [[victim]] protection, paying particular attention to [[children]] and other vulnerable [[groups]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
5597	[[I]] regret the presence of the President of Zimbabwe, Mr [[Mugabe]], at the summit held in Tripoli on 30 November, and the absence of numerous European [[Heads of State]] or [[Government]].	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
5598	To conclude: there has been substantial agreement with the views of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and the rapporteur, Mr [[Hoppenstedt]], whom [[I]] congratulate on an excellent piece of work.	Male,Amb
5599	Thank you Mr [[Striby]] and Mr [[Pasty]], [[I]] have taken note of your remarks.	Male,Male,Amb
5600	Mr [[Chanterie]] rightly said, as did earlier [[speakers]] too, that the speed at which they are processed leaves much to be desired.	Male,Amb
5601	In view of the fact that this category of [[worker]] consists mainly of [[women]], and that the directive to be amended concerns implementation of the principle of equal treatment, it is imperative to include such workers in these schemes, since failure to do so will clearly represent discrimination against women.	Female,Female
5602	Madam [[President]], the [[Commission]] would like to thank the Committee on the Environment and in particular its rapporteur, Mr [[Virgin]], for the work done by the committee on this proposal.	Female,Amb,Male
5603	[[I]] understand that this approach has found favour with you, Mrs [[Bjerregaard]].	Amb,Female
5604	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] will not go over the fundamentals of this agreement as they have been described by Mr [[Kindermann]], who has rightly highlighted the fact that only one of the three states, Lithuania, has so far also accepted the second generation component.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Male
5605	[[I]] hope that at least the request by Mr [[Christodoulou]] that forced expenditure on an expensive arms procurement programme for defence purposes by a Member State will be recognized as an exceptional circumstance.	Amb,Male
5606	My [[Party]] sought to cite the Scottish [[Secretary's]] name in the Censure Motion against Mr [[Hogg]] in Westminster this week.	Amb,Amb,Male
5607	Already in 1957, Article 119 of the treaty instituting the European Community stipulated: ' Each Member State provides..... the application of the principle of equality of remuneration between male [[workers]] and female [[workers]] for the same work' .	Male,Female
5608	[[I]] will give several figures, which seem to me very encouraging. Half of the young civil [[servants]] recruited from the new Member States are women.	Amb,Female
5609	Needless to say, [[I]] willingly admit to Mr [[Herman]] that [[we]] had hoped to achieve more, and I can tell [[you]] that we will achieve more.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
5610	Mr [[President]], [[we]] are taking part once again in a debate on equal opportunities because it is always our intention to contribute to making equality a reality and also to add a male voice to the voices of the women [[Members]] who are calling for it and demanding it.	Male,Amb,Female
5611	Mr [[President]], Mr [[Torres Couto]] has made a good analysis of the problems and challenges for small and medium-size [[companies]] in Europe, and [[I]] would like to thank him.	Male,Male,Amb,Amb
5612	I come to [[you]], not as the British Foreign [[Secretary]]. I come to you as the President of the General Affairs Council.	Amb,Amb
5613	It is also a sector which has experienced considerable restructuring but which has subsequently greatly strengthened its competitiveness and is now making sure it is the world market [[leader]].	Amb
5614	On the report itself, [[I]] would like to support the broad criticism by the [[rapporteur]] of the lack of genuine action in the [[Commission]] proposal.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5615	[[I]] should like to welcome Mr [[Marín]] and ask him to reply to Mrs [[Izquierdo Rojo's]] question.	Amb,Male,Female
5616	Mr [[President]], please allow [[me]] - I could not do so just now - to join Mrs [[Dührkop]] in thanking the entire [[staff]] of the Committee on Budgets. Their assistance in the course of my work was absolutely invaluable.	Male,Amb,Female,Amb

5739	The recommendations set out in the report drawn up by Mrs [[Sierra González]] - whom [[I]] congratulate warmly although there are no more than half a dozen of [[us]] here - the recommendations set out in the report, as I was saying, for the structural funds to play a far more substantial part in the materialization and construction of infrastructures, in education, training and research-related aspects, naturally deserve our full support.

5823	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] have taken the floor to explain the reasons why I am going to vote against the motion and my concern over two issues, which were included in the resolution at the request of some [[Members]], who, I feel, are trying to exploit the credibility of the European Parliament in order to further their own interests, which conflict with the general interests of the Community as a whole and Italy in particular.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
5824	[[I]] would like to expressly thank Mrs [[Buitenweg]] for her excellent work and I assume that [[we]] will adopt this report by a clear majority today, even if the [[Commissioner]] responsible has let it be known here today that she cannot accept half the amendments.	Amb,Female,Amb,Female
5825	Mr [[President]], [[I]] have asked for the floor in order to add to Mrs [[Napoletano' s]] words.	Male,Amb,Female
5826	[[We]] also thank the [[Minister]] for being present, and we naturally hope that his cold will clear up.	Amb,Male
5827	As the [[author]] is not present, Question No 12 lapses.	Amb
5828	[[I]] would like to tell [[you]] that yesterday, the French Presidency - led by the [[President]] of the Republic - the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mrs [[Albright]], and I spent the whole day trying to reach an agreement that both [[parties]] could sign.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
5829	The proposed Charter is unique in the way it gives a central place to the [[citizen]] and her rights.	Female
5830	[[We]] know, too, that we need the assumption that a [[victim]] of any nationality will be treated in the same way as a [[victim]] of the nationality of the country in which the offence takes place.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5831	Mr [[President]], there is no option but to agree with the idea that any [[person]] with the right to move freely within the European Union should be protected by a social security system, regardless of whether they are employed or unemployed.	Male,Amb
5832	[[I]] should like to express my annoyance at the fuss just made by Mrs [[Van der Laan]].	Amb,Female
5833	[[MEPs]] will have a second opportunity to discuss ICT and development subjects at the October session of the EU-ACP Joint Assembly, on the basis of a report by Mrs [[Junker]].	Amb,Female
5834	Not all of our amendments were adopted, but the report makes a significant improvement on the [[Commission' s]] proposals in various ways. It falls short, however, of what [[we]] would like to see in this field, specifically with regard to the concept of [[child]] pornography and to the penalties that could be imposed for such activity.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5835	Mr [[President]], [[I]] believe that one of the main reasons for the excellence of this report is the quality of the [[person]] who produced it, because it is a real pleasure to work with her.	Male,Amb,Female
5836	Mr [[President]], Mr [[Vice-President]], first [[I]] think [[we]] should all congratulate Mr [[Jarzembowski]] on his excellent work, the time he spent on it and, of course, his patience, because this is an exceptionally tricky issue.	Male,Male,Amb,Amb,Male
5837	Mr [[President]], first of all, congratulations to Mrs [[Isler Béguin]] on her report which [[I]] think is excellent and constructive.	Male,Female,Amb
5838	On behalf of the [[Commission]] and my [[colleagues]] here present, [[I]] would therefore like to thank the Committee on Budgets, its Chairman, Mr [[Wynn]], your rapporteurs Mr [[Colom i Naval]], Mr [[Podestà]] and Mr [[Färm]], for the quality and speed of their cooperation.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Male,Male,Male
5839	The best approach is one whereby the [[government]] pays for the education that a [[person]] receives before entering the labour market.	Amb,Amb
5840	Also, Mrs [[Maes]], the problem raised today by these two death sentences reveals changes in the borders made by the [[Chinese]].	Female,Amb
5841	Mr [[President]], [[I]] should like to thank the [[Commissioner]] for what he has said, and also Mrs [[Sandbæk]] for so eloquently defining why this is such an important and urgent regulation for [[us]] to deal with tomorrow.	Male,Amb,Male,Female,Amb
5842	Fortunately the proposals of the rapporteurs, Mrs [[Thyssen]], Mrs [[Patrie]] and Mr [[Whitehead]] are moving in more or less that direction.	Female,Female,Male
5843	[[I]] wish Mrs [[Napoletano]] every success with her task, and I would like to assure her that she can totally rely on the full support and cooperation of the [[Commission]] in her work.	Amb,Female,Amb
5844	[[We]] agree with or subscribe to this announcement and express our solidarity with the Palestinian People's Party and the Palestinian [[people]] in general, who are being given a particularly hard time at the moment by the [[Sharon]] regime, which is taking advantage of the fact that the world's attention has turned elsewhere, including to Iraq, in order to promote and complete its crime.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5845	Foreign [[troops]] and national [[militia]], with countless [[child soldiers]] among them, have free play to plunder the country of its assets of gold, uranium, oil and diamonds to their heart's content, destroy fields and villages, rape [[women]] and [[girls]] on a massive scale and assist one ethnic [[population group]] in massacring [[another]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Female,Amb,Amb
5846	For the reasons that [[I]] have just given, Mrs [[Mann]], our preference is therefore still for a joint approach with the ASEAN countries.	Amb,Female
5847	Some of the [[women]] did in fact obtain more votes at the party conference than some of the [[men]] but were listed beneath men with fewer votes because, according to our rule, every other [[person]] on the list must be a woman.	Female,Male,Female
5848	Let [[me]] quote the typical example of the decoupling of subsidies from production, which the [[rapporteur]] welcomes, together with the conversion of intervention schemes to simple insurance networks and the exit of [[farmers]] from the market to become businessmen, to quote Mr [[Fischler]].	Amb,Amb,Male,Male
5849	My lady [[colleagues]] and [[I]] had ourselves submitted amendments to these own-initiative reports, only – as we are accustomed to doing – to see them fail in the [[Committee]] on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and that is why we have resubmitted some of them to be voted on.	Female,Amb,Amb
5850	The [[Junker]] report must be viewed in terms both of what it states explicitly, but also in terms of what it implies.	Amb
5851	[[We]] have noticed over this period that the financial perspective, as Mr [[Colom i Naval]] pointed out in one of his working papers, is indeed somewhat rigid and requires certain changes.	Amb,Male
5852	[[I]] would like to take this debate as a starting point, by saying that I agree with the [[Commissioner]], that there must be nothing automatic about nominations being made by certain countries, and that it would have been a good thing if [[we]] had had several [[candidates]] for the seats available, and hence a competing array of qualities, principles, opinions and fundamental beliefs to choose from.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5853	To conclude, [[I]] therefore ask [[you]] to vote in favour of this very satisfactory report proposed by our fellow MEP, Mr [[Weber]].	Amb,Amb,Male
5854	It is calculated that 90% of the [[people]] suffering from these diseases are [[women]].	Female,Female
5855	Mr [[President]], the report by Mr [[Graefe zu Baringdorf]] discussed here today identifies clearly and concisely the shortcomings and flaws of the risk and crisis management system in European agriculture.	Male,Male
5856	[[I]] would like to conclude by thanking Mrs [[Bauer]] for a fine report.	Amb,Female
5857	But [[we]] hope to cooperate very well with any [[candidate]] put forward by Mr [[Radwan]].	Amb,Amb,Male
5858	[[I]] say that the situation is economically confused because, while I agree with the [[Commission's]] view that the economic situation is good, or at least much better than it was previously, I must emphasise that our potential 2% growth is not enough to absorb Europe's [[unemployed]], to keep pace with our [[competitors]] or to maintain our standard of living.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5859	When I worked as a [[professor]], I was saddened to find that some universities, particularly those that always appear right at the top of the major rankings - for example British elite universities such as Oxford and Cambridge - were extremely reserved when it came to the Erasmus programme, in contrast to many other universities.	Amb
5860	Or perhaps Mrs [[Prets]] or Mr [[Poettering]] can tell [[us]] whether they would allow product placement in a television drama in order to promote the sale of Volkswagens, and [[I]] call on Chancellor [[Merkel]] and Mr [[Neumann]], her minister of state for culture, now that the German Presidency of the Council is about to begin, to go beyond half-hearted resistance to product placement and give a clear indication of their opposition to it.	Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Female,Male
5861	[[We]] are awaiting a clear answer at last from the [[players]] in the European space industry, regarding financial participation, the mode of funding based on a 2/3 formula, since this is what was stated in the call for tenders.	Amb,Amb

5863	At Monday's meeting of the General Affairs Council, the Foreign [[Ministers]] of the European Union called for an immediate end to the violence and assured President [[Abbas]] of their full support for his decisions.	Amb,Male
5864	[[President-in-Office]] of the Council. - (PT) Mr [[Papadimoulis]], I think that, as regards questions of human rights in our relations with Turkey, the Presidency and the Council have been clear, demanding and firm both now and in the past, as they will also be in the future.	Amb,Male
5865	[[author]]. - Mr [[President]], I should like to emphasise that the [[Greens]] are very aware that the consequences of a totally liberalised textile and apparel market for EU-based [[producers]] is still a very pressing issue, particularly for certain production zones within the EU in which the industry is highly concentrated.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
5866	15% of [[people]] with higher education are [[women]].	Female,Female
5867	But what [[I]] would say is that [[we]] always have to be very careful about giving arbitrary powers to a [[chairman]] or a [[president]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5868	In any civilian missions of the European Union, this responsibility lies with the [[head]] of the mission under the civilian operation [[commander's]] leadership.	Amb,Amb

5870	[[author]]. - (ES) Mr [[President]], two years ago [[I]] had the opportunity, as part of a mission headed by Mrs [[Isler Béguin]], my colleague, who is in the Chamber here, to visit Sierra Leone, to attend the Special Court and to become aware of the huge task that it was accomplishing, not only for Sierra Leona, but also for [[mankind]] as a whole.	Amb,Male,Amb,Female,Amb
5871	Mr [[Duff]], the rule on when there are a large number of amendments in plenary and the [[President]] can ask a [[committee]] to look at it: it is not a referral back to committee of the report.	Male,Amb,Amb
5872	(FI) Madam [[President]], Mr [[Czarnecki]] perhaps does not know that on 22 December 2009, a European [[government]] admitted for the first time that there had been such a secret detention centre on its own territory.	Female,Male,Amb
5873	[[We]] regret the lack of timely, reliable, comparable data, at both regional and EU level, for the indicators decided on for the follow-up to the Beijing Platform for Action, including [[women]] and poverty, violence against women, institutional mechanisms, women and armed conflict and the girl [[child]].	Amb,Female,Female
5874	These [[women]] should be given the same opportunities as their male [[colleagues]] without having to resort to quotas and the like.	Female,Male
5875	[[I]] would like to dedicate this minute to a [[baby]] boy who I met on 1 December 2009 in Luanda, when [[we]] were in Angola for the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly.	Amb,Male,Amb
5876	This is why, in view of all these crises and questions and in accordance with our mandate, [[we]] wanted to produce a practical follow-up to [[Mario Monti's]] findings, and indeed to the consistent findings that this [[Parliament]], under the guidance of Mr [[Grech]], whom [[I]] thank, has also come up with concerning the imperfect, incomplete, and occasionally disappointing, functioning of this large single market.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
5877	As this possibility has been introduced by the working [[group]] on parliamentary reform, [[I]] am very sympathetic to that and [[we]] have enough time, but nevertheless I have to ask the [[speaker]] if he will take all those questions.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male
5878	[[I]] very much wish, in the name of consistency, that [[colleagues]] would be equally interested in repression of the rights of [[representatives]] of other religions, because we are very often told by other countries that we are one-sided and biased, so I think this is a question of real coherence and credibility.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5879	Next June, Vice-President [[Almunia]] will present to [[you]] the Report on Competition Policy 2010.	Amb,Amb
5880	Mr [[Tavares]], [[I]] hope you will forgive me, but [[we]] are so far behind schedule that I had to cut you off.	Male,Amb,Amb
5881	Let [[me]] finally draw your attention to another factor: many honourable [[Members]] have raised the political issue of the relationship with Morocco - the Sahara issue and others.	Amb,Amb
5882	[[I]] can only say that the British [[Government]] and the British [[Minister]] for Agriculture have announced that they are now in a position to put a proposal on the table, as regards the additional slaughter programme, by the end of this month at the latest.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5883	Madam [[President]], [[I]] should also like to express my thanks for the [[Ombudsman's]] activity report and the report by Mrs [[Ahern]].	Female,Amb,Amb,Female
5884	The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0266/96) on behalf of the [[Committee]] on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position established by the Council (C4-0331/96-95/0107(SYN)) with a view to the adoption of a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community (rapporteur: Mr [[Virgin]]).

5887	My colleague Mrs [[Cresson]] has made it clear that the [[Commission]] does not agree with the stance which the [[Council]] has adopted on the matter.	Female,Amb,Amb
5888	Reading that book in translation - [[I]] was unable to read it in Chinese, as I do not have that ability - I came across the famous phrase in which [[Mao Zedong]] says that instead of giving a [[child]] a fish to eat, it is better to give him a rod to fish with.	Amb,Amb,Male
5889	Petty pedantic speculation or issues of national egoism, such as the issue of the [[President]] of the Central Bank, should not obscure the true context of Economic and Monetary Union, the common vision of European integration, which must not of course be a reason for excluding and marginalizing some countries.	Amb
5890	The national [[parliaments]] do not have the competence to decide the appointment of the [[head]] of the ECB, whereas they do decide the appointment of the [[president]] of their own central banks, as the Greek Parliament recently did.	Amb,Amb,Amb
5891	Madam [[Commissioner]], that amounts to subsidising [[them]].	Female,Amb
5892	However, there is reason to believe that the harsh working hours contribute to a significant drop-out rate, with a particular impact on women junior [[doctors]].	Female
5893	[[We]] are driving ourselves into a dead end by flouting [[MEPs']] prerogatives, by flouting the European Union' s history of parliamentarianism and that of all its Member States. And because we do not want to rectify mistakes that we made six months ago, we are prepared to institutionalise informing within our Parliament, which allows any [[assistant]] or [[official]] in Parliament to inform on [[someone]] because he suspects that so and so' s [[brother-in-law' s]] [[cousin]] may have committed fraud!

5982	[[I]] hope that that feeling of dissatisfaction with the reply has nothing to do with the fact that Commissioner [[Patten]] is British, but, on the other hand, on the most important issue - the repair of the submarine in a European Union port which does not meet the minimum requirements - he said that this was an internal issue for the United Kingdom, when, according to the Euratom Treaty, this is not the case; and, on the other hand, he simply said that he would keep [[Parliament]] informed.	Amb,Male,Amb
5983	Madam [[President]], may [[I]] suggest to you that the adoption of Amendment No 46, does not mean Amendment No 47 falls. In my [[group' s]] view, it constitutes a wholly useful complement and is in no way opposed to the wording of Article 46.	Female,Amb,Amb
5984	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to start by congratulating my colleague, Mrs [[Ghilardotti]], as well as the [[Council]] and the [[Commission]] for having finally secured progress on this dossier.	Male,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
5985	And, of course, [[we]] all know what that means, we just have to make allowances for the usual abusive response by the Turkish foreign [[secretary]] towards the honourable Mr [[Poos]] and his report, which is seen as negative towards Turkey.	Amb,Amb,Male
5986	[[We]] should like the following to be added to this section: "welcomes in this respect the future meeting between the [[president]] of Cyprus and the [[leader]] of the Turkish [[community]]".	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
5987	. (DE) [[I]] have not voted for the compromise motion of Article 15(1) proposed by Mrs [[Paciotti]] and Mrs [[Palacio]].	Amb,Female,Female
5988	What [[I]] would welcome is for the plan for a [[task force]], which was set up during the previous European Summit and which mainly aims to implement policy, to be coupled to this idea of structural reforms.	Amb,Amb
5989	The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is asking that the Government of Burma should now release from arrest the Nobel Prize [[winner]], her [[fellow-campaigners]] and the political [[prisoners]].	Female,Amb,Amb
5990	Mrs [[Stihler]] may like to note that it was, in this respect, more Eurosceptic than the British [[Conservatives]].	Female,Amb
5991	At that time I was the youngest Member of Parliament and, including me, there were only two women [[Members]].	Female
5992	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], Mr [[Bradbourn]], [[I]] would first of all like to welcome the ambitions of this trans-European network programme.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb
5993	Mr [[President]], [[I]] welcome the [[Commissioner]] and wish to pick up on something he referred to rather poignantly: development aid through trade.	Male,Amb,Male
5994	Every year, [[Parliament]] criticises this trend and [[we]] have again just heard Mr [[Ferber]], Mrs [[Guy-Quint]] and Mrs [[Trüpel]] echo this dissatisfaction.	Amb,Amb,Male,Female,Female
5995	For this reason, [[I]] ask [[you]] to stand by what you said in your strategic guidelines and what you presented to [[us]], together with Mrs [[Wallström]] and Mr [[Verheugen]], in the Lisbon strategy, which formulates these very principles: greater flexibility and more competition, certainly, but also an enduring commitment to the social structures that are Europe’s greatest achievement.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Male
5996	[[I]] am among [[those]] who believe that, when a job is performed in accordance with a certain number of rules, this also enables the [[worker]] to give his best and often to be more efficient.	Amb,Amb,Male
5997	Some fellow [[Members]] have also mentioned that the European [[public]] expects increased common action among the Member States in the field of foreign and security policy.	Amb,Amb
5998	The European Union, as you quite rightly said [[Commissioner]], has made material and credible contributions to the current negotiations.	Amb
5999	[[Europeans]] must be aware that what Mr [[Solana]], Mr [[Winkler]] and Mrs [[Ferrero-Waldner]] have set out is none other than the neighbourhood policy of the European Union, on whose doorstep lie the crisis regions that they have described.	Amb,Male,Male,Female
6000	In its Agenda 2000 – and [[I]] am happy to refer to that because I was a [[member]] of the Steering [[Group]] for Agenda 2000, which was adopted in 1997 – the [[Commission]] examined the impact of the accession of central and eastern European countries from two angles: its impact on EU policies such as agriculture or regional policy, and its budgetary consequences.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
6001	The very procedures for gaining access to the world of work, the terms and conditions of contracts, and the availability of [[family]] support services to [[parents]] and [[relatives]] of [[those]] requiring care, to give just a few examples, seriously interfere in practice with many [[women’s]] personal freedom of choice to develop a career to the same level as their male [[colleagues]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Male
6002	– Mr [[President]], Mr [[Gargani]] is right to ask for [[Parliament]] to be consulted on the modification of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities.	Male,Male,Amb
6003	on behalf of the GUE/NGL [[Group]]. - (FI) Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[I]] was going to say Madam [[Minister]], but I will not.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Female
6004	[[I]] am very grateful to the German Federal [[Chancellor]] for her clear statement and also for the fact that the results of this conference and its conclusions will be on the agenda not only of the Health [[Ministers']] Council, but also of the summit in June.	Amb,Female,Amb

6006	[[Vice-President]] of the Commission. - Madam [[President]], I wish to begin by congratulating the [[rapporteur]] on her report.	Amb,Female,Female
6007	on behalf of the PPE-DE [[Group]]. - (PT) Madam [[President]], [[I]] note the spirit of compromise shown by the Socialist benches and, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I must say that [[we]] are also open to compromise and will not therefore oppose this suggestion.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb

6010	The interesting report by Mrs [[Miguélez Ramos]] and the discussion it has initiated amount to a characteristic object lesson, a further justification for maintaining humility in the face of the mysteries of the deep - humility, may [[I]] add, that requires the necessary compensation at least in the form of research into the deepest European basins, the scope of which is regularly enlarged.	Female,Amb
6011	[[Presidents]], [[Ministers]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[we]] cannot remain silent in the face of the tragic events which took place last week in Guinea.	Amb,Amb,Female,Male,Amb
6012	In September this year, the Supreme [[Court]] in Colombo sentenced a [[journalist]] to 20 years' imprisonment, which the EU Presidency regarded as a threat to freedom of speech and which was roundly condemned.	Amb,Amb
6013	[[Member]] of the [[Commission]]. - I hope the honourable [[Member]] will respect the fact that I will not go into detail about one draft out of many that has been leaked.	Amb,Amb,Amb
6014	(DE) [[Madam President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], it is, of course, completely normal in the European Parliament to begin by thanking our fellow [[Members]], but in the case of this directive, [[I]] believe that it is actually appropriate to start with this expression of thanks.	Female,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
6015	On the contrary, this particular resolution calls for more [[women]] to be employed in [[police]] and military missions and for the EU to deploy more women [[officers]] and [[soldiers]] in CSDP missions.	Female,Amb,Female,Female
6016	Fourthly, and here [[I]] need to thank Commissioner [[Piebalgs]] for having already addressed one of my concerns in his answer to Mrs [[Keller]], the European Investment Bank already takes all these factors into account.	Amb,Male,Female
6017	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to thank the [[Commissioner]] for her introduction.	Male,Amb,Female
6018	Madam [[President]], [[I]] must say that I am very concerned about some of the aspects I have listened to here in Parliament recently - tonight, the shortage of rare earth elements; last night, the 80% deficiency in protein; a few weeks ago, sugar beet factories being closed down and now [[we]] have a deficiency in sugar.	Female,Amb,Amb
6019	Indeed, it is the leading country in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), with whom the European Union signed a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in November 2009, and currently holds the [[chair]] of ASEAN.	Amb
6020	In a quiet country lane in Rettendon, three drugs-related execution-style murders today remain unsolved and a Billericay [[businessman]] was found shot dead in his car with £5, 000 of drugs money left on the dashboard.	Male
6021	It is regrettable that there was no [[expert]] with environmental or food law experience on the Molitor [[Committee]].	Amb,Amb
6022	Mr [[President]], a British [[friend]] of [[mine]] lives in fear that her Greek [[ex-husband]] will snatch their small [[son]] and take him to Greece.	Male,Female,Amb,Male,Male
6023	[[I]] urge the [[Commissioner]] to take no notice of those comments from the [[chair]], because I think [[we]] very much want to listen to her.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
6024	Until [[I]] can be assured of that, I can only support the [[rapporteur's]] opinion that these procedures should not be permitted until [[we]] have clear and transparent controls over the way in which they are applied.	Amb,Amb,Amb
6025	The second aspect that [[I]] should like to emphasize is what Mr [[Fabra Vallés]] says in Point 10 of his motion for a resolution, in which the [[Committee]] on Budgetary Control demands that the EU should have its own independent anti-fraud [[unit]].	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
6026	My [[wife]], my [[daughters]] and my female [[friends]] have told [[me]] with finesse and humour, not to say irony, that they absolutely do not want the sort of equality extolled by Mrs [[Kestelijn-Sierens]].	Female,Female,Female,Amb,Female
6027	Some of my female [[colleagues]] have omitted to mention this.	Female
6028	A strong point of criticism from the rapporteur, Mrs [[Cederschiöld]], is that no clarity has been established on the question whether crime will be combatted by harmonization of the definitions of the most important punishable crimes, or by the system of improved cooperation between the Member States, whilst keeping intact the differences between national judicial systems.	Female
6029	This is a sound principle, that [[NGOs]] should be self-financing to some extent.	Amb
6030	[[Madam President]], the original text refers to a justification for the old legal basis.	Female
6031	The Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr [[Junker]], is saying that the euro is not an eternal shield.	Male
6032	In conclusion, Mrs [[Krehl]], [[I]] believe I have already answered your question on creating a separate common service, on staffing policy and administration.	Female,Amb
6033	The report by Mr [[Schmid]] relates to an action plan to promote safer use of the Internet.	Male
6034	In the meantime, a fictitious UNITA is being created in Luanda. The UN [[representative]] was prevented from talking with the real and historic UNITA and the mistrust has grown.	Amb
6035	[[I]] believe that today we not only need to congratulate the [[rapporteur]] on her report but that we can also congratulate ourselves as a Parliament for our dogged, lengthy and ultimately successful efforts to achieve a number of improvements to the original [[Council]] proposal and hence to the common position too.	Amb,Female,Amb
6036	It has been my consistent opinion that unless greater efforts are made to involve [[fishermen]][['s]] organisations in the decision-making process the best efforts of Community [[legislators]] will fail.	Amb,Male,Amb
6037	[[I]] think [[you]] are quite right in that respect, although I would point out that Mr [[Bourlanges]] has also spoken, as well as Mr [[Valdivielso]].	Amb,Amb,Male,Male
6038	Mr [[Verheugen]], you may have noticed that on 23 March the European Parliament indicated its desire for a substantially greater proportion of women [[Members]] of the next [[Commission]] than there is at present.	Male,Female,Amb
6039	If [[you]] will allow [[me]], I would like to say a few words in particular - I think my male [[colleagues]] may forgive me for this - to my fellow women [[MEPs]], who have always given me wonderful support, as have [[others]].	Amb,Amb,Male,Female,Amb
6040	Mr [[Staes]], [[I]] should like to point out to you that a Parliament in which [[we]] have so many female [[colleagues]] cannot, by its very nature, be a eunuch!	Male,Amb,Amb,Female

6146	As stated in particular in [[Parliament’s]] resolution on the Annual Policy Strategy adopted earlier this year, [[we]] need in Europe as a whole to be able to adapt more quickly to the phenomenon of globalisation, which is changing the global economy and changing the orientation of our priorities to one of ‘policy for results’ – as the [[President]] of the Commission has explained.	Amb,Amb,Amb
6147	Out of the 191 countries that are currently members of the UN, only seven have a [[woman]] as a head of state and eight have a female [[head]] of [[government]].	Female,Female,Female

6149	Mr [[President]], [[I]] too would like to thank the [[rapporteur]] for his work on this excellent report.	Male,Amb,Male
6150	[[Member]] of the Commission. - Mr [[President]], in conclusion, I would firstly like to say that this discussion has clearly shown that you have very strongly understood the frustration of the Tibetan [[people]].	Amb,Male,Amb
6151	My third point is that Frontex has still not solved one problem which you, [[Commissioner]], raised when you said that [[we]] should contribute to bringing down the number of dead and missing [[persons]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
6152	The fact that today male [[colleagues]] have participated in this debate may, [[I]] believe, be a reflection of the fact that [[men]] must also stand beside [[women]] in the fight for equality.	Male,Amb,Male,Female
6153	As Mrs [[Ţicău]] pointed out, the UK is not party to the Visa Information System as the country is not in Schengen, so the UK has full control of its own borders.	Female
6154	[[I]] should now like to say, before the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr [[Vondra]], whom I wish to thank for his speeches, before the Czech Presidency and before all of [[you]], that I should like to thank you for what we have managed to accomplish together, despite all our differences of opinion, for Europe, which is a major project for peace, freedom, and solidarity.	Amb,Male,Amb
6155	[[Madam President]], [[Commissioner]], [[I]] was very pleased to see you here and hear you speak.	Female,Amb,Amb
6156	Mr [[President]], with respect, [[I]] think the honourable [[Member]] has completely missed the point, because twice she said 'the [[people]] that were elected last week'.	Male,Amb,Female,Amb
6157	As you said, [[Minister]], political will does exist in the European Parliament.	Amb
6158	Mr [[President]], a few weeks ago, my estimable friend and Yorkshire colleague, [[Edward McMillan-]][[Scott]], brought the [[chairman]] of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to this assembly and presented him as a legend in his own lunchtime and a top climate science guru - and [[I]] have to say that he certainly looked like a guru to me - but it turns out that he is a railway engineer who writes mucky books.	Male,Male,Amb,Male,Amb
6159	[[author]]. - Mr [[President]], in Amendment 4, contrary to the voting proposal, I suggest voting against, because of the agreement with Greek [[colleagues]].	Amb,Male,Amb
6160	The main area of trafficking involving [[children]], in particular, [[girls]] and [[women]], has not changed for many years.	Amb,Female,Female
6161	[[I]] shall again leave it to the discretion of the [[Minister]] as to whether he wishes to deal with this.	Amb,Male
6162	In this regard, Mrs [[Harms]] and Mr [[Schulz]] rightly lamented the lack of European spirit.	Female,Male
6163	Nevertheless, [[they]] can offer the opportunity for a new beginning and they do, at least, introduce a degree of pluralism into the system.	Amb
6164	The [[Commission]] can only think of one solution for the problems facing the fisheries sector: indiscriminately cutting the number of ships, which amounts to curing the illness by killing the [[patient]].	Amb,Amb
6165	It is a good [[model]], too, because of the different things he did.	Male
6166	Nevertheless, [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], in the European Union, [[we]] have a certain type of drug that is not intended for [[sportspeople]] but for [[farmers]] - in the form of uneven levels of support for them.	Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
6167	In this light, [[I]] consider the report submitted by the [[rapporteur]] to be very important, and I think that the processes he has outlined will enable [[us]] to modify the apparatus used to assess financial products so that the conclusions that are offered, either by rating [[agencies]] or by other mechanisms, will result in more objective ratings of financial products.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
6168	The death of this highly respected [[person]], well known and appreciated for his outspokenness and his defence of the identity of Turkish and Greek Cypriot values, and highly regarded for his attachment to human rights, can only be strongly deplored.	Male
6169	Thank you for pointing that out, Mrs [[Schroedter]].	Female
6170	Thank you, Mr [[Macartney]].	Male
6171	Accusations have been made against a [[person]] in his political [[group]] and [[I]] must provide the opportunity to rebut them, but I would thank him not to prolong the matter.	Male,Amb,Amb
6172	Not to mention the fact that a whole string of leading Islamic [[figures]], such as Mr [[Nazarov]], are constantly locked up or threatened in their own homes, and their [[families]] subjected to various pressures.	Male,Male,Amb
6173	My last point, which links in with Mrs [[Berès']], is that my own foreign [[secretary]], now standing down, warned Europe against a Europe dominated by [[finance ministers]].	Female,Amb,Amb
6174	[[Companies]] are constantly complaining to [[me]] and I know they complained to the [[Commissioner]] when he was kind enough to come to my constituency.	Amb,Amb,Male
6175	[[I]] would also like to thank my fellow [[members]] of the Economic Committee, in particular Mr [[Rübig]] who is here with [[us]] this evening, for their assistance in getting us to this stage.	Amb,Male,Male,Amb

6240	Madam [[President]], [[I]] simply wanted to add my voice to that of Mrs [[Palacio Vallelersundi]] before the vote started, to say that I regret very much the absence of the [[Council]] from this debate on such important votes on matters of the Third Pillar.	Female,Amb,Female,Amb
6241	Mrs [[Kauppi]], you cannot expect some [[members]] of governments within the European Union to be happy about sitting alongside [[people]] who they consider to be apologists for ideologies which clearly remind them of another period in history and which raise old European ghosts.	Female,Amb,Amb
6242	From this point of view, [[I]] believe that Mrs [[Neyts-Uyttebroeck]], whose path has taken the opposite course, having moved on from Parliament to the Council, can introduce a degree of freshness into the work of the Council.	Amb,Female
6243	Mrs [[González]], the whole [[House]] shares your feelings and, as far as our [[institution]] is able, [[we]] will take all possible measures to ensure that such an atrocity cannot be carried out.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb

6245	Mr [[President]], I am a [[friend]] of Israel and I am proud to be so.	Male,Amb
6246	Having read Amendments Nos 192 to 196 in the name of Mrs [[Kauppi]], Mr [[Harbour]] and [[others]], [[I]] think that does a rather elegant job and, in any event, between now and the final vote, it is up to [[us]] to try and bring it together in such a way that we get a clear, intelligible and workable package at the end of the day.	Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
6247	Mr [[President]], for a pluralist [[assembly]] such as ours today is a great day, both because of the very well-produced report by Mr [[Laschet]] in which all types of suggestion have been accepted, and because of the presence of the Secretary-General of the UN, [[Kofi Annan]], in order to receive the Sakharov Prize, which represents a strengthening of International Law as the only way to resolve conflicts internationally.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb
6248	Let [[me]] repeat that I recognise the dedication with which my honourable [[friend]] has pursued this matter and I am sorry that, for the reasons which I have adduced, I am not able to give him on this occasion a reply which will, I suspect, satisfy him wholly or in part.	Amb,Male
6249	She is, to put it mildly, a controversial [[figure]].	Female
6250	Secondly, if the [[Minister]] does come here, he will be coming without an invitation.	Male
6251	No [[judge]] was found who was prepared to do his duty.	Male
6252	The backwardness of the past 50 years is exemplified by the absence of any legislation criminalising [[child]] trafficking, by the falsification of [[government]] documents, the many homicides that go unpunished, the obstruction of human rights [[activists]] in their activities, the poverty in which 56% of the [[population]] live, and lack of almost any opportunity for the indigenous [[peoples]] to take part in political decision making.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
6253	Thirdly, [[we]] would like to say to our Palestinian [[friends]] ― [[I]] have said this personally on several occasions since the elections, and I am able to speak to the [[President]] practically every day ― that it would be a very good thing for the new [[government]] which emerges following these elections, in three months, also to recognise all of the agreements that the Palestinian [[Authority]] has signed over recent years.

6256	Consulting one [[citizen]] and not [[another]] will result in two speeds; that must not be allowed to happen, and believing as [[we]] do that clarification of that would be helpful, that is what we would like to see.	Amb,Amb,Amb
6257	The [[Chair]] had to do his best to respond to the [[Chamber's]] astonishment, which is understandable given the conflict [[we]] have seen today between two sources of legitimacy.	Male,Amb,Amb
6258	The German [[Minister]] of Foreign Affairs has expressed his concern.	Male

6262	(DE) Mr [[President]], my delegation, the Austrian Social [[Democrats]], abstained from voting on the report on the Bali conference for precisely the reasons that Mrs [[Korhola]] has also raised.	Male,Amb,Female
6263	The only way to do that is to enable our industry to remain in the forefront of technological, ecological and social innovation with the support of a highly skilled [[labour force]].	Amb
6264	Raising the retirement age in line with the rise in average life expectancy means that a 45-year-old [[worker]] has yet to reach the mid-point of his career.	Male
6265	Even where that [[candidate]] does have a true majority, doubts remain about the size of that majority, certainly where manifest attempts have been made to inflate it artificially.	Amb
6266	[[I]] would also like to thank the [[Commission]] very much, especially the [[Commissioner]], for the awareness she has always shown in what I would term her fireproof advocacy of a more competitive electronic communications market and [[consumer]] protection.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb

6269	[[I]] would also remind one dear [[colleague]] and friend, who is not actually listening to me, of a compatriot of hers, [[André Gide]], who said that everything exaggerated lacks value, and I think [[we]] need to set things straight.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
6270	[[We]] have a [[Commissioner]] and a [[Minister]] just going through the motions.	Amb,Amb,Amb
6271	After all, a moment ago, [[we]] heard here from the [[Commissioner]] that the European Commission evaluates new directives from the social, economic and ecological point of view, and so there is no need to panic.	Amb,Amb
6272	On the basis of the recommendation made to the European Parliament in the report by my excellent colleague and friend, Mrs [[Mathieu]], [[I]] voted in favour of granting the [[Director]] of the European Agency for Reconstruction discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for 2008.	Female,Amb,Amb
6273	on behalf of the [[Verts]]/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr [[President]], Cambodia is a very beautiful country with a great history, but there are dark sides to both the country and its history.	Amb,Male
6274	(LT) First of all, [[I]] would like to congratulate my group [[colleague]] for her significant work negotiating this document and including it in the issues that are especially important for the energy market of the entire European Union.	Amb,Female
6275	To close, [[I]] call on you [[Madam President]], as a female president, to circumvent the rules and to give the floor to the remaining ten female [[speakers]] for this special ceremony for [[Women's]] Day.	Amb,Female,Female,Female
6276	[[I]] would like to pay tribute to all of our female fellow [[Members]] in the European Parliament, and to think at this point about the [[women]] in North Africa and in the Middle East who are showing true courage in their fight for democracy.	Amb,Female,Female
6277	If the negotiations go well, both [[parties]] will benefit: sustainable development will be promoted, [[child]] labour will gradually be eradicated and a more progressive form of social protection will be upheld.	Amb,Amb
6278	Women [[doctors]], as Mrs [[Baldi]] has said, are also being forcibly stopped from attending the [[sick]] and sick women are being told they cannot be examined by male [[doctors]].	Female,Female,Amb,Male
6279	There is a continual area of tension between the ideal and often bitter reality, where the biblical truth is confirmed that [[man's]] instinct is towards evil.	Male
6280	But, as Mr [[Virgin]] corrects the [[Commission's]] errors in his report, [[I]] gladly vote for his report and the excellent amendments from the Environment [[Committee]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
6281	European action with regard to the fight against [[child]] abuse must therefore be coordinated and painstaking but it should also be concentrated, otherwise this scourge will never end.	Amb
6282	Mr [[President]], Mr [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], as [[we]] are talking about transit today, we are, of course, also going to be talking about the fact that for 40 years in Europe we have supported a common market and that we have therefore always promoted a [[society]] based on the principle of the division of labour.	Male,Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
6283	Thank you, Mr [[Smith]].	Male
6284	Madam [[President]], [[I]] completely agree with Mr [[Söderman]] that if the EU had had a culture of open administration, whereby the [[public]] could inspect the files of its [[officials]] once they have been finalised, [[we]] would be able to avoid a great deal of fraud and many irregularities.	Female,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
6285	Mr [[President]], on behalf of the Socialist Group, [[I]] should like to join with Mr [[Martens]] in paying tribute to your work, to your profile and to your commitment as President of this Parliament over the last two and a half years.	Male,Amb,Male

6323	The review appreciated the "thriller-cum-adventure" style of the book and concluded, "The [[author]] sets so many questions to the [[reader]] in her story, questions which will almost certainly be answered wrongly, that [[no one]] is likely to nod over it, and even the most experienced reader of romances will fail to steer an unerring course and reach the harbour of solution through the quicksands and shoals of blood, diamonds, secret service, impersonation, kidnapping, and violence with which the mystery is guarded."

6368	In the case referred to by the honourable [[Member]], the advisory [[committee]] on appointments shortlisted a female [[candidate]] with good qualifications.	Amb,Amb,Female

Female,Amb,Female,Male,Amb
6370	Once again, [[I]] would like to thank the [[rapporteur]] for the excellent job which she has done and I hope that as a result our programmes in this very important sector will be both generous and better focused and managed.	Amb,Female
6371	The early departure of the United States left the European Union in the position of main [[speaker]] and basically left it to shoulder the main burden of the negotiations.	Amb
6372	Therefore, despite what Mrs [[Fleming]] said, the [[Commission]] cannot accept the part of Amendment No 20 or Amendments Nos 40, 41, 42 and 43, which give the Commission the responsibility of conducting strategic environmental assessments, when European legislation in the Directive adopted in 2001 establishes that the task is the responsibility of the Member States.	Female,Amb
6373	Before [[we]] proceed to the next vote [[I]] should like to give a warm welcome to Mrs [[Fan]], President of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, who is in the distinguished [[visitors]]' gallery today.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
6374	[[We]] cannot simply oppose options that [[some]] consider to be warmongering; we must provide a response that is proportionate to the threats made by the other side, in the shape of [[someone]] who, in the past, has shown complete contempt for international law and who is still failing to provide guarantees that he will respect such law now and in future.	Amb,Amb,Male
6375	[[We]] are pleased to note too that the [[candidate]] may not stand for re-election, so her independence is guaranteed.	Amb,Female
6376	For example, when the City Marathon took place in January, Austrian Broadcasting (ORF) played 'You Sexy Thing' as the female [[winner]] approached the finishing line.	Female
6377	[[I]] would like an assurance from the [[Minister]] that, if he has not done any pilot projects yet, if there are going to be any, or any real projects by Member States, he carries out that statistical exercise before allowing the projects to take place.	Amb,Male
6378	[[I]] believe that cultural diversity, as a sensible countermeasure to the melting pot, is an absolute necessity and I am most grateful to Mrs [[Prets]] for producing this very comprehensive and detailed report. I also thank Commissioner [[Reding]] for providing such a detailed overview of the work from her own perspective and for pointing out that this [[House]] is and should remain the natural ally of the [[Commission]] and especially of Commissioner Reding herself.	Amb,Female,Female,Amb,Amb
6379	[[I]] am aware that some [[people]] have doubted the willingness of the States in relation to specific aspects and, just today, the rapporteur, Mrs [[Sanders-ten Holte]], has indicated that [[we]] are going to closely monitor how the States of the Union develop in terms of the implementation of this Single European Sky.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
6380	It is also important to recognise that it is a long process and that, as Mrs [[Bonino]] said, [[we]] need to be consistent.	Female,Amb
6381	Mr [[President]], it cannot be denied that the past European [[Council]] was actually dominated by an external factor, that being the referendums on the European Constitution that are due to be held in various European countries.	Male,Amb
6382	Mr [[Wurtz]] has the floor to speak against the proposal.	Male
6383	The [[Commission’s]] recent communication said that [[victim]] protection is the top priority, but Member States tend to lump trafficking together with illegal immigration and prefer to make victim protection conditional on being a [[witness]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
6384	Mr [[President]], [[I]] congratulate my colleague Mrs [[Fourtou]] on her balanced report.	Male,Amb,Female
6385	The unfortunate [[victim]] of the rape did not, however, receive any kind of compensation or psychological support even though this could have been made available to her.	Female
6386	[[I]] hope the [[Commissioner]] will tonight confirm her agreement with the UN [[Commissioner]] for Human Rights that her office in Colombia retain the double mandate, including monitoring, not restricting its duties to simply technical assistance.	Amb,Female,Amb

6388	[[rapporteur]]. - (HU) Before the vote, which should be very straightforward, I have to correct a regrettable error.	Amb
6389	Mr [[President]], [[I]] congratulate our [[rapporteur]] for her work in steering this important report through Parliament.	Male,Amb,Female
6390	This means that [[we]] expect Syria, as [[you]] have stated in the motion for a resolution, to pass the right messages to [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]], to prevent arms shipments into Lebanon, as our [[colleague]] from the Council has said, and to help with the settlement on the Shebaa Farms.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
6391	Its role as [[leader]] of the Eurogroup should be strengthened in order better to reflect the significance of the euro in the international context as well.	Amb
6392	[[We]] are giving a great deal of money, perhaps too much, as our fellow [[Member]] from the Union for Europe of the Nations Group said, and now we should strengthen the idea of Euroeast.	Amb,Amb
6393	[[I]] really am grateful to the [[rapporteur]] for all the work that she has put into preparing it.	Amb,Female
6394	Commissioner [[Kroes]], Commissioner [[Špidla]], [[I]] entreat you: do be [[men]] and [[women]] of steel, do ensure that all the rules are properly observed.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Female
6395	[[We]] do not need a colourless, flavourless, odourless [[figure]] who dances to the tune of the European Commission.	Amb,Amb
6396	Mr [[President]], thank you, [[Commissioner]], for tabling a proposal at last.	Male,Amb
6397	[[I]] welcome the [[Minister]] to this first Question Time with the Spanish Presidency.	Amb,Amb
6398	In other European countries organs, [[I]] am sorry to say, are lost, not because the [[family]] members were unwilling to give consent, or because the [[victim]] does not have a [[donor]] card or had stated that they did not want to donate their organs, but, for most organs in Europe that are lost, it is quite simply due to the fact that the [[doctors]] do not have enough time to deal with this matter.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
6399	[[I]] would emphasise three points. Firstly, I welcome the European Commission's proposal on the health and safety at work of pregnant [[workers]] and [[workers]] who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding.	Amb,Female,Female
6400	As several of the [[speakers]] have already said, the current proposal is here, of course, because a [[citizen]] from your own country, from the south of England, challenged the system and because the Court of Justice vindicated her rights.	Amb,Female
6401	(PT) Mr [[President]], in my capacity as [[Chair]] of the Committee on International Trade, [[I]] should like, first and foremost, to express my satisfaction that [[we]] are about to successfully conclude our first major test in exercising the codecision powers that the Treaty of Lisbon has granted us in the area of trade agreements.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
6402	Our [[Ambassador]] to Iraq arrives today, and she knows the importance that [[I]] attach to this issue.	Female,Amb
6403	[[I]] suppose, however, that it is only to be expected, given the fact that although the UNHCR was initially consulted about the first draft, after that a deaf ear was turned to all the advice offered by the UN [[High Commissioner]] for [[Refugees]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
6404	The means of reversing this unfortunate trend are well known, and are to some extent set out in the practical proposals from Mr [[Katiforis]].	Male
6405	On page 15 of the Minutes, [[I]] see that the [[president]] of the sitting responded to the [[speakers]] who raised the arguments just mentioned, saying that 'two [[Members]] spoke and this left enough time for Members to get to the Chamber' .	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
6406	As far as [[I]] am concerned, I asked to be called, as Mrs [[Ewing]] quite rightly said, on each roll-call vote.	Amb,Female
6407	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], although the idea of a transnational European Volunteer Service is to be welcomed - and [[I]] should like to express to the [[rapporteur]] my appreciation of all the work she has done -, I fear that the objective set out in the report will not be achieved due to a lack of funds.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Female
6408	[[I]] thank my other honourable [[friend]] for her further supplementary - which I think covers another aspect of this.	Amb,Female
6409	The [[Commission]] responded and set up an organizational working [[party]] chaired by Mr [[Oreja]] and [[myself]].	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
6410	It is, after all, through the [[Ombudsman]] that [[citizens]] of the EU have been given the chance to know how our [[administration]] works.	Amb,Amb,Amb
6411	[[I]] would begin in the usual way by thanking the rapporteurs, Mrs [[Dührkop Dührkop]], Mr [[Viola]] and certainly Mr [[Giansily]] as well.	Amb,Female,Male,Male
6412	Clearly, this new office, its [[director]] and its various [[departments]] will be available to [[Parliament]] and all the other [[institutions]] which are also required to carry out checks and investigations.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
6413	Madam [[President]], could you point out to the new [[colleague]] that this is a European Parliament and if he wants to continue with his narrow nationalist views maybe he should have been elected to the Scottish Parliament?	Female,Male
6414	One of [[them]], a man, said to [[me]], and I quote: 'The example you gave is entirely appropriate.	Male,Amb
6415	Mr [[White]] has been our guide through this political jungle, and [[I]] must congratulate him.	Male,Amb
6416	In Mrs [[Ojala's]] report, [[we]] find criticism of the fact that the Advisory [[Committee]] and the Safety and Health [[Commission]] have too few women [[members]].	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
6417	[[I]] would inform the [[House]] that Mr [[Crowley]] has endorsed the [[minority]] opinion which is set out in the explanatory statement.	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
6418	What has, however, changed drastically, is how the programme is implemented, for one of the reasons for the European [[Commission's]] resignation early last week was the mismanagement of [[Leonardo]].	Amb,Amb
6419	So thank you very much, Mr [[Chanterie]] and Mr [[McMahon]]!	Male,Male
6420	Mr [[President]], Madam [[Minister]], [[I]] agree with you that the death sentence imposed on the Kurdish leader Mr [[Öçalan]] constitutes a significant challenge for the international [[community]], since it violates minimum requirements in terms of justice as well as respect for human rights.	Male,Female,Amb,Male,Amb
6421	However the collaboration with Mrs [[Palacio]] is to work, it will be decided in conjunction too with our colleague Mr [[Barnier]], the Commissioner-designate for Regional Policy.	Female,Male
6422	[[I]] believe [[everybody]] in this House would welcome the opportunity to give a very positive and assertive vote in favour of the proposals put forward by Mrs [[Smith]] in her report with regard to reducing the transitional period to four years.	Amb,Amb,Female
6423	The [[rapporteur]] applies certain questionable criteria, for example she accuses the [[Commission]] of having limited itself to applying [[Council]] guidelines.	Female,Amb,Amb
6424	Madam [[representative]] of the Council, [[we]] have listened to [[Kofi Annan' s]] report on the most recent information regarding the referendum and we attended the 25th Conference on the support by European NGOs of the Saharaoui [[people]] a few weeks ago in the Canary Islands.

6510	Experience is obviously invaluable, but in order to guarantee a [[citizen]]-oriented approach [[we]] ought now to be thinking about the sort of age and gender distribution there should be among the Convention' s other [[members]] so that the EU can really be brought closer to its [[citizens]] and in particular the [[shapers]] of the future, that is to say, the [[young]].

6511	The [[minister]] says that he supports the UN and is monitoring the talks, but why is he not offering the services of the Council in trying to broker a solution?	Male
6512	[[I]] must start by saying that I fully share the regret expressed by other female [[colleagues]] at the sadly symbolic, worrying fact that, despite the many good intentions expressed, of the [[members]] of the European Convention planning the future of Europe and therefore the future of the rights of European [[citizens]] - both [[men]] and women - only 16% are women, which I feel is a genuinely disturbing figure.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Male
6513	Therefore, [[Commissioner]], if [[we]] want the [[farmers]] to understand your proposals, bearing in mind that the Spanish [[Minister]] for Agriculture's strategy is head-on opposition, [[I]] believe you should consider this question and that the Commission must propose measures to provide direct information, because what we have in Spain at the moment are ridiculous parodies.

6516	[[I]] was surprised to discover that Mrs [[Honeyball]], an MEP for the UK Labour Party, is calling for a [[Commission]] directive on annual road taxes in the European Union, and on the structure of car purchase tax on the grounds of completing the single market, when the UK [[Chancellor]] of the [[Exchequer]] is quoted on the front page of today's newspapers as saying '[[We]] must explicitly reject old flawed assumptions that a single market should lead inexorably to tax harmonisation, fiscal federalism and then a federal state'.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
6517	My final point is that, with regard to labelling catches as tuna-friendly and purchasing [[dolphin]]-friendly tuna, [[we]] must be sure that practices are genuinely tuna- and dolphin-friendly, that there is no huge by-catch with caught tuna and that [[people]] do not purchase such products because they think they are both conservation-friendly and by-catch-friendly, when, in fact, a large number of [[turtles]], [[sharks]] and [[dolphins]] are evidently being caught.

6525	This phenomenon is not limited to Paris, for, in Berlin too, there are districts in which fires cannot be put out in good time or the [[injured]] taken away because it is impossible to communicate with the rampaging foreign [[mob]], by which [[those]] trying to help risk being attacked or robbed - so-called 'no-go areas', in which even the [[police]] now venture only en masse.

6541	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], first [[I]] too would like to thank the [[rapporteur]] for her work on behalf of our [[group]].	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Female,Amb

6543	This report is an example of that hard work, though the subject of better air traffic management is one which Mr [[Cornelissen]] addressed years ago in the Dutch parliament too and has continued to address with great industry.	Male
6544	Her mistake was to marry a [[Frenchman]] and go and live in France where [[she]] has been refused employment as a [[teacher]] despite having considerable experience of teaching.	Male,Female,Female
6545	The second mistake which [[I]] think that the [[rapporteur]] has made concerns the subject matter itself, i.e. do [[we]] really want the same rules governing the withdrawal of driving licences in the EU.	Amb,Amb,Amb
6546	So [[I]] would like both to thank Ms [[Ghilardotti]] and congratulate her on her report as [[we]] will find it easier to take action as a result of this report.	Amb,Female,Amb

6637	When [[Angel]] greets [[her]] with the usual affection the next morning, she thinks he has forgiven her; later she discovers the letter under his carpet and realises that he has not seen it.	Male,Female
6638	Since 2000 he is a freelance [[writer]].	Male
6639	[[Sprout]] learns that Mrs. [[Miller]], too, has a drinking problem.	Amb,Female
6640	[[I]] would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and, like Mr [[Désir]] and several other [[speakers]], I feel that the European Union which [[we]] are forming can take the initiative in this respect.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
6641	Mr [[President]], in response to a question put to him during a radio interview on 20 January last, the Russian [[Ambassador]] to Paris declared that what the [[Russians]] were doing in Chechnya was fighting terrorism and that Europe and the whole world would subsequently thank Russia, when they understood the issue.	Male,Amb,Amb
6642	Bearing in mind these limits, it will be rather difficult, when [[we]] set out to assess the new common foreign and security policy structures in terms of defence, to say to the Military [[Committee]] or the Military [[Staff]] that half of their [[soldiers]] should be female.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
6643	Hitherto, in fact, only 8% of European freight transport is intermodal, as my [[colleague]] just said.	Amb
6644	In this respect, there are various [[speakers]] - Mr [[Caveri]], for example - who call for the great transport axes which are already in the TENs to be developed.	Male,Male
6645	[[We]] have thus focused on the [[man]] instead of stigmatising the [[person]] who is prostituting herself.	Amb,Male,Female
6646	Sixthly, is it true that the six opposition [[candidates]] were arrested after the election and one of these, Mr [[Yorongar]], was beaten and wounded?	Male,Male
6647	Report (A5-0323/2001) by Mrs [[Corbey]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on implementation of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste 2000/2319(INI)	Female,Amb
6648	At this rate, [[Putin]] and [[Bush]] will soon have a say in our interest rate.	Amb,Amb
6649	This message should go out loud and clear, Mr [[President]] of the Council, particularly because it is important for the Council of [[Ministers]] to present a united front on this matter, and support the work of our [[representative]] in the Middle East. [[Parliament]] made its views clear through the resolution adopted by an overwhelming majority in the February plenary.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
6650	Madam [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would like to begin by thanking the [[Council]] and the [[Commissioner]] for their words and, of course, congratulating the rapporteurs, Mr [[Bushill-Matthews]] and Mrs [[Bastos]].	Female,Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Female
6651	B5-0556/2002 by Mr [[van den Bos]], on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Iran;	Male
6652	What percentage of that income is then paid to the [[worker]]?	Amb
6653	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to thank the [[rapporteur]] for his patience and determination.	Male,Amb,Male
6654	In spite of his best efforts, the [[rapporteur]] has not succeeded in improving the common position, which really does not add anything in terms of quality.	Male
6655	[[We]] hope that the post of [[Chairman]] of the European Council will in time be merged with that of Commission [[President]] in an integrated Presidency.	Amb,Amb,Amb
6656	For my part, [[I]] agree with the [[rapporteur]] that market [[operators]] - businesses and Member States, in other words - are perfectly capable of safeguarding security of supply.	Amb,Amb,Amb
6657	In the [[Committee]] on [[Women’s]] Rights and Equal Opportunities, it is a cause of grave concern to [[us]] that the proportion of women in the next Parliament will be lower, and so every effort must be made to underline the political will from the top downwards.	Amb,Female,Amb
6658	On 31 March the European [[Parliament]] adopted a resolution in which it disagrees with the [[Commission]] that the current US undertakings represent adequate protection, and the [[College]] will decide in due course how to proceed.	Amb,Amb,Amb
6659	Illiteracy among [[women]] is far more widespread than among [[men]] and the right to life for female [[children]] is subject to far greater risks.	Female,Male,Female
6660	Today, a delegation from this Parliament, made up of the [[presidents]] of all the political groups, and the largest of the delegations to go to Auschwitz, will participate in the ceremony in tribute to those [[victims]], together with former [[prisoners]], [[Heads of State]] or Government of many countries and some of the [[soldiers]] who liberated the camp.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
6661	Mr [[President]], [[I]] should firstly like to thank the [[Commissioner]] for his answer.	Male,Amb,Male
6662	It is my sad duty to inform [[Parliament]] of the death of our much-loved colleague Mr [[Imbeni]].	Amb,Male
6663	Mr [[President]], Mr [[President-in-Office]] of the Council, honourable [[Members]], dear [[friends]], it is a great honour for [[me]] to represent the [[Commission]] in this ceremony in this Parliament that represents [[Europeans]].	Male,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
6664	[[I]] shall end by congratulating my [[colleague]] from the bottom of my heart on his wonderful work.	Amb,Male
6665	[[I]] might also mention that, in the example I cite, the [[doctors]] who discriminated between [[women]] and [[men]] in issuing prescriptions were women.	Amb,Female,Female,Male
6666	When the [[passenger]] failed to comply with his orders, he was executed in cold blood in the embarkation area.	Male
6667	If progress has been made – and it has – it is only thanks to [[Parliament]], its negotiating [[team]] and the [[rapporteur]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
6668	In Estonia, for instance, where [[women]] were granted full suffrage in 1918, still only one fifth of [[members]] of parliament are women, and women hold only every seventh ministerial position – that is, 14%.	Female,Female
6669	(FI) [[Madam President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would like to thank the [[rapporteur]] very much for some excellent work.	Female,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
6670	[[I]] would therefore like to offer the rapporteur, Mrs [[Hieronymi]], and Commissioner [[Reding]] my heartfelt congratulations.	Amb,Female,Amb
6671	In the case of [[those]] who preside over this House, that may well not be so, and may even be cause for amusement, but when a [[woman]] working on a production line earns 30% less than her male [[colleagues]], it is not funny any more.	Amb,Female,Male
6672	Secondly, [[I]] would like to say to the [[Commissioner]] that, according to her own analysis, consumption of wine is falling in the European Union, our trade balance with third countries is deteriorating and [[we]] have a production surplus that the Commission puts at 15% of the total for 2011.	Amb,Female,Amb
6673	on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to thank the [[Commissioner]] for her understanding and quick reaction.	Male,Amb,Female
6674	[[I]] am aware that it is not easy for a British [[deputy]] to free herself from domestic political considerations, and that she was successful in doing so. Therefore she deserves all our respect, and I support the report.	Amb,Female
6675	As a [[member]] of the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, I believe it is important to emphasise that the document that has been adopted can contribute positively to making European Union foreign policy more effective, and can also enhance its effectiveness in the international diplomatic arena.	Amb
6676	on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam [[President]], [[I]] should like to say to the [[Commissioner]] that I am encouraged by the fact that we share the same worries and goals and I thank her for her presentation and description of the developments.	Female,Amb,Female
6677	[[I]] would like to commend the [[rapporteur]] for his laying down practical instructions and showing [[us]] the way forward.	Amb,Male,Amb
6678	Mrs [[Jensen]] has been addressing this. [[We]] still have the American GPS, the [[Russians]] have GLONASS, and the [[Chinese]] are setting something up.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
6679	on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam [[President]], rarely do decisions debated in this House have such serious consequences for such a large number of [[people]].	Female,Amb
6680	There is only one [[colleague]] that [[I]] want to respond to, and that is Mr [[Davies]] - hereinafter known as 'Chris 'Newsnight' Davies', for the programme that he likes appearing on - who said that I gave in too easily in the [[Council]].	Male,Amb,Male,Amb
6681	[[I]] find this a little fishy, even by the standards of this House, so I do not think she was the right and proper [[person]] to be rapporteur for this report.	Amb,Female
6682	But what happened in the 10 years between 1998 and 2008, when the euro was in situ and Mr [[Trichet]] and his [[predecessors]] were pursuing their policies, was that almost 16 million jobs were created.	Male,Amb
6683	The result of this process is eagerly awaited by [[judges]], public [[prosecutors]] and legal [[professionals]] who cooperate on a daily basis and also by the [[victims]] who suffer from the forms of crime which are constantly adapting and changing.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
6684	Indeed, this is also mentioned repeatedly in the report by Mr [[Saryusz-Wolski]].	Male
6685	However, [[I]] really want to focus on the EU-Africa Partnership aspect of that.	Amb
6686	A good [[friend]] said to [[me]] recently that she had been in the United States and she had been surprised by the lack of knowledge regarding the new institutions and the new procedures created by the Treaty of Lisbon.	Female,Amb
6687	[[I]] think that Mr [[Lehne's]] proposal to exempt micro-[[entities]] from the burden of annual accounting, thus producing a reduction in administrative bureaucracy, is a positive one.	Amb,Male,Amb
6688	As for the rest of your answer, [[Commissioner]], you recited the Commission's usual prayer book, but experience shows that the Commission, your Commission, and the European Court of Justice are passing judgment on the basis of the European treaties, in accordance with a fatal principle, that of free and undistorted competition, and are therefore creating illegal access to housing construction and to housing itself.	Amb
6689	I am, moreover, a [[supporter]] of more freedom of choice for pregnant [[women]] or [[women]] who have recently given birth.	Amb,Female,Female
6690	As shadow [[rapporteur]] for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for this dossier, I also want to thank all my fellow [[Members]] who made their contributions.	Amb,Amb
6691	- (SK) Madam [[High Representative]], the European foreign service has a large number of [[employees]], [[specialists]] and [[analysts]].	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
6692	[[I]] voted in favour of the report by our fellow Member, Mrs [[Ţicău]], on transport applications of global navigation satellite systems.	Amb,Female
6693	[[I]] move that [[we]] take that point now under the procedure that Mrs [[Green]] said was agreed by the political [[groups]] last week; that is, [[whoever]] catches your eye in the Chair.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
6694	During the last few days, an important meeting has been held in Addis Ababa, attended by virtually all the most important [[factions]], [[groups]] and [[parties]] in the Somali conflict.	Amb,Amb,Amb
6695	[[We]] should ensure these [[people]] can be properly provided for in terms of housing, medical care, education for their [[children]] and so on.	Amb,Amb,Amb
6696	the report (A4-0343/97) by Mr [[Linkohr]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the communication from the [[Commission]] to the [[Council]], the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee, and the Committee of the Regions on the energy dimension of climate change (COM(97)0196 - C4-0232/97), and-the statements by the Council and Commission on the third conference on climate change (Kyoto, December 1997).	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
6697	Mrs [[Cresson]], [[I]] see that you are with [[us]] today.	Female,Amb,Amb
6698	[[I]] have been advocating this for 20 years, but I have to say that while the schools may be made drug-free, the [[students]] will all too often have taken the stuff before they get there.	Amb,Amb
6699	In this case [[I]] would suggest - and Mrs [[Flemming]] has already touched on this - that the Leonardo programme should receive at last 100 % extra funding.	Amb,Female
6700	[[I]] agree with Mrs [[Graenitz]] in that it is very gratifying to see that the Austrian presidency will be addressing the declaration on the environment and employment at the Environment Council in October.	Amb,Female
6701	It involves cooperation all along the food industry chain, quality control from the field to the [[consumer's]] table.	Amb
6702	Mr President, Mr [[Valverde López]], of course the [[Council]] is aware of the importance of the conservation of books, which have until now been the primary medium for the transmission and dissemination of cultural matter.	Male,Amb
6703	[[I]] thank the [[Council]] for taking a swift decision to bring this case to the European Court of Justice, but as we have to be the pioneers in an administration which is open and efficient, so Mr [[Prodi's]] [[Commission]] should get ready for the test in September.	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb

6787	[[I]] consider the question of the representation of the European Parliament on the Centre's Management [[Board]] to be equally important, which is why I propose that two [[members]] of Parliament should be nominated as observers, who will regularly report back to the [[committee]] responsible.

6790	The third point [[I]] wanted to make – and this is to reiterate what Mr [[Méndez de Vigo]] and Mr [[Brok]] said – is that there are two key issues that [[we]] are looking at from this side.	Amb,Male,Male,Amb

6793	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] congratulate the [[rapporteur]] on the work she has done, which above all has the merit of bringing the intent of our legislation closer to the criteria that [[we]] promised to fulfil at Kyoto.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Female,Amb
6794	My thanks also go to Chairman [[Lewandowski]] and the [[staff]] and [[secretaries]] that have assisted [[me]], particularly my peerless [[assistant]] – please excuse this personal note, but it is sincere and well-deserved – in the gruelling work of recent months; I am sure she will continue to do it.

6798	It is also because of this, Mr [[Špidla]], that if the Portuguese [[Government]] has not yet invited you to visit the region, which is facing a real social emergency, [[I]] myself am inviting you, Commissioner, as I want you to see for yourself the seriousness of the situation, support the efforts that are being made and mobilise all the instruments that the [[Commission]] has at its disposal to prevent the lack of confidence throughout the region from spreading even further.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
6799	In 2006, 32.6% of [[managers]] in the EU were women.	Female
6800	[[I]] would also like to thank the [[rapporteur]] for his work.	Amb,Male
6801	That is the reason behind my question, Commissioner [[Ashton]]: do you see concluding the free trade agreement with South Korea as a first step towards further bilateral free trade agreements, and does that, in your view, mean a move away from Doha?	Amb
6802	Indeed, [[I]] am very concerned about the problem of the balance between [[men]] and [[women]]; if I do nothing, I will have practically no women, because the [[governments]] generally want only male [[candidates]] for the next [[Commission]].	Amb,Male,Female,Amb,Male,Amb
6803	Madam [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], Mrs [[Fischer Boel]], you gave a very brief response on the subject of the crises and [[I]] did not hear you mention any possible solutions to these crises.	Female,Amb,Female,Male,Female,Amb
6804	My private opinion is that it is partly due to the unconsidered - let [[me]] say, unwise - visits by Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], who met [[Alexander Lukashenko]] and praised him as a democratically elected leader but did not find time to meet with the [[opposition]], and also, a little earlier, by the [[President]] of Lithuania, who has invited Lukashenko to Lithuania, in an ill-considered way, I would say.	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
6805	(DE) Mr [[President]], Mr [[Mann]], [[I]] hope you are in regular contact with your [[Chancellor]], if you see things in the same way that I do.	Male,Male,Amb,Amb
6806	[[I]] would like to ask you, Mr [[President]], whether this is in accordance with the rules and, if it is not, what punishment the extreme Romanian [[politician]] may expect for his [[assistant]] voting in his stead.	Amb,Male,Male,Amb
6807	Mr [[Martin Schulz]] did not say a word when a [[minister]] of the socialist government in Hungary gave the order, through his direct political [[associates]], to defame a [[journalist]] who had become a nuisance to him by having drugs placed in his car.	Male,Male,Amb,Male
6808	That will be the result of agreeing with Mr [[Gauzès]].	Male
6809	The report from Mrs [[Estrela]] deals with the issue of reducing health inequalities in the EU.	Female
6810	In this regard, [[I]] am particularly grateful to your [[committees]], to the [[rapporteurs]], to Mr [[Schwab]] and Ms [[Wallis]] and to the shadow [[rapporteurs]] for their hard work in search of a compromise.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Female,Amb
6811	[[Madam President]], for a start, [[I]] pay tribute to my [[colleague]] who has just spoken for her tireless work on human rights.	Female,Amb,Female
6812	But first [[I]] should like to acknowledge, Madam [[Commissioner]], that [[we]] fully appreciate that the agreement has been achieved and for a four year period, and with regard to that period I associate myself with the request made by the [[chairman]] of the Committee on Fisheries that the appropriate guarantees be secured to that end.	Amb,Female,Amb,Male
6813	Finally the IOC, which moreover has only one woman [[director]], will only consider a boycott, it is said, after international discussion and condemnation.	Female
6814	On behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations [[I]] should particularly like to thank the [[rapporteur]] for agreeing to accept the new conclusions from our committee which he has incorporated in his work and for which I had the honour to draft the opinion.	Amb,Male
6815	Secondly, [[I]] should also like to stress a point which has already been made by Mr [[Andersson]]: a follow-up procedure stands or falls on certain tests.	Amb,Male
6816	Given that the Permanent Secretary, Mr [[Packer]], who attended in place of Mr [[Hogg]], informed [[us]] that BSE was an act of God, we perhaps should be grateful that [[Douglas Hogg]] did not attend.	Male,Male,Amb,Amb
6817	All [[we]] need is for the [[patient]] to agree to take the medication.	Amb,Amb
6818	After contact with Mr [[Tomlinson]] - responsible for the 1998 budget - [[we]] came to the conclusion that, on the basis of the supplementary and amending budget which we are presenting at the moment, we could, in 1997, award 23 posts; the other 25 could be included in Mr Tomlinson's preliminary draft.	Male,Amb
6819	[[I]] also contacted the [[journalist]] involved yesterday and I told him that there were inaccuracies and I followed it up with a letter of which [[you]] can have a copy.	Amb,Male,Amb
6820	Then, one month later, [[you]] probably read that a FIFA [[representative]] declared, in Singapore, if [[I]] remember correctly, that he was going to contact several European [[Prime Ministers]] in order to resolve the problem. In other words, they were going to bypass the [[Commission]] for they were tiresome, these Commission [[officials]] who dealt with such problems.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
6821	Although [[one]] does not vote on the reasoning behind a report, Mrs [[Jensen's]] line of reasoning has such a weak scientific basis - and gives the impression that it is on this basis that [[we]] are voting in Parliament - that [[I]] am voting against this report.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
6822	Like Mr [[Virgin]], [[I]] believe that [[we]] need to reconsider the definition of waste.	Male,Amb,Amb
6823	This includes not only driving time and time spent loading and unloading the vehicle, but also all the other time during which the [[worker]] is at his [[employer's]] disposal. This needs to be approached cautiously and impartially, because if [[companies]] are faced with an unreasonable definition of working time, they are in danger of becoming non-viable and possibly going bankrupt.	Male,Amb,Amb
6824	[[I]] have noted to my satisfaction the [[Ombudsman's]] positive attitude towards [[civil servants']] freedom to write and say what they wish.	Amb,Amb,Amb
6825	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], at the start of what [[I]] should like to say, let me also express my thanks to the [[rapporteur]] and my respect and appreciation for her work.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Female

6927	During our visit [[we]] visited the Claremont coffee estate, where 50 [[families]] who have lived and worked on that estate for three generations, living in what can only be described as feudal conditions, were thrown off their farm because the [[owner]], who happens to be the sister-in-law of the country’s [[president]], decided that she did not want them on the estate and wanted to change what they were doing.

6933	One point must be clear, but it has been clearly stated several times, both in the report by Mr [[Fava]] and in the Council of Europe report: a parliamentary report can set out facts, but Parliament naturally has neither the power nor the duty to conduct a judicial inquiry.	Male
6934	[[I]] would like to thank my [[colleague]] for waiving his supplementary and thank the [[President-in-Office]] for taking the question.	Amb,Male,Amb
6935	What purpose, Madam [[Commissioner]]?	Female
6936	So let [[me]] just tell [[you]] that in 2008 the [[Commission]] needs to decide on the scope - in respect of the time schedule, content and form - of the CFR, and how to carry out the above work in terms of methodology, human and financial resources and distribution of work amongst the DGs concerned: Justice, Freedom and Security, the Internal Market and Services, Enterprise and Industry, the [[Secretary]]-[[General]], and Health and Consumer Protection.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
6937	[[I]] support the initiative by the Socialist Group President, Mr [[Schulz]], who sought to use this revision to prevent the French [[leader]] of an extreme-right party from having the honour of chairing the inaugural session of the new parliament.	Amb,Male,Amb

6947	[[I]] thank the President-in-Office, Mr [[Mitchell]], for a very full reply.	Amb,Male
6948	Since the [[rapporteur]] has only thanked his PSE [[colleagues]], [[I]] hope he will not take offence if at the end of my statement I warmly thank him for his work over these two years even though he is a member of the PSE!	Male,Amb,Amb
6949	If a [[Member]] chooses to defend himself from an accusation made against him by means of a letter, then the least that we can do as [[democrats]] is to listen to his reply.	Male,Amb
6950	Apart from that issue, if [[I]] were giving the [[Commissioner]] a mark for her endeavours at the [[Council]] meeting I would give her 6 out of 10.	Amb,Female,Amb
6951	[[I]] believe that she is a good [[person]] for the task.	Amb,Female
6952	Let [[us]] challenge [[them]] strongly.	Amb,Amb
6953	The fact that female business [[people]], in the financial services for example, often encounter difficulties is a great handicap for the operation of a business, especially for the whole small business structure.	Female
6954	That is why not only the [[representative]], but in my opinion also the [[Commissioner]], should keep a closer eye on things, so that it is not the national [[firms]] only who are awarded contracts, but that instead contracts are spread over the entire [[Community]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
6955	In the report by Mr [[Gasòliba I Böhm]] [[I]] can see that there is an orientation towards issues of development and employment, but I fear that this positive orientation of the rapporteur is being sacrificed in the name of consensus.	Male,Amb
6956	Mr [[President]], please permit [[me]], despite the fact that today is Thursday - a play on words which perhaps only [[Scandinavians]] will understand - to ask for a correction to the Minutes.	Male,Amb,Amb

7055	[[Madam President]], [[Commissioner]], [[we]] are very concerned about the human rights situation and also by the slow progress of democracy in Equatorial Guinea.	Female,Amb,Amb

7062	Mr [[President]], the previous [[speaker]] will probably be amazed to find that [[I]] agree with everything she said.	Male,Female,Amb
7063	– Mr [[President]], Mr [[President of the Commission]], Mr [[President-in-Office of]] the [[Council]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], those who bear responsibility at the outset of things – Mr President-in-Office of the Council – have a decisive influence on what happens in later years.

7064	There, [[they]] are exploited not only for work, but also for various deviant practices, including sexual practices, paedophilia and [[child]] pornography.	Amb,Amb
7065	. – Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], the directives [[we]] are debating today are of key importance in three respects, namely with regard to the regulations in force throughout Europe that provide social protection for [[employees]], with regard to road safety and with regard to competition.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
7066	Pornography is certainly in there, but so too is the fight against discrimination, as are [[teacher]] training and, finally, the right of reply, though it is not really clear of what possible benefit this might be to [[minors]].	Amb,Amb
7067	Freedom and responsibility instead of chains, protectionism, nationalism and partitioning transitional rules – these things are our goal, and they will provide common added value for the [[citizens]] of Europe.	Amb
7068	Our liberal [[colleague]] from the Netherlands is quite humble when it comes to assessing tolerance in her country.	Female

7073	[[I]] can tell Mrs [[Isler Béguin]] that, if the [[Commission]] and the [[Council]] have given the same answer three times over, that does not mean that they have given a wrong or incomplete one; that is the legal position.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
7074	Let [[me]] end by quoting what [[Jean Monnet]] said: 'I have always believed that Europe would be built through crises and that it would be the sum of their solutions'.	Amb,Amb
7075	[[I]] am also comforted in my view that fair trade is better than free trade, and of course that trade on the basis of solidarity with a weaker [[partner]] is more important than formally fair and reciprocal trade.	Amb,Amb
7076	Sixthly, as to whether female [[prisoners]] should be allowed to have a pregnancy initiated in prison, this is by no means a non-controversial issue.	Female

7078	on behalf of the GUE/NGL [[Group]]. - (ES) Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[Commissioner]], [[Minister]], the Fifth Summit certainly has a specific agenda to discuss social exclusion and poverty.	Amb,Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
7079	So [[I]] do not think that this hotline established or initiated by my fellow Commissioner Mrs [[Kuneva]] could be used, for instance, for [[victim]] protection, because it is a very different issue. It is much more complicated.	Amb,Female,Amb
7080	(IT) Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] am pleased to see that I am still admired by many [[colleagues]], whom I should of course like to thank for having waited to hear why I voted in favour of the [[Weber]] report.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
7081	[[I]] think there is absolutely no contradiction between this request for an urgent debate on the issue and the hearing that Mrs [[Flautre]] is organising for 16 July.	Amb,Female
7082	This young [[farmer]] - and she is trained - has read the soils directive and has a real concern that for [[someone]] like her who is using minimum cultivation, doing the right think for the soil, this directive will penalise her, particularly in unseasonable weather conditions.	Female,Amb
7083	The new United States [[Government]] under President [[Obama]] is pleased that this common European policy exists, as it means that the United States has a [[partner]] in tackling a number of these problems.	Amb,Amb,Amb
7084	[[I]] would also like to thank the [[Commissioner]] for what she said about [[animal]] cloning.	Amb,Female,Amb
7085	(ES) Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to make two comments, each regarding aspects of the conclusions of the European Council from the perspective of the [[chair]] of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and, therefore, involving the area of freedom, security and justice.

7086	The European Union always wants to be a [[leader]], and always has.	Amb

7090	Firstly, [[I]] should like to thank Mr [[Coelho]] for the quality of his report and for the true expertise that he brings to all his work on visa policy.	Amb,Male
7091	Therefore, this still does not make the [[judge]] a human rights activist - she has never expressed herself on this point.	Female
7092	Experience from recent years shows that securing transport into affected areas is not possible without technical and organisational support from military [[units]].	Amb
7093	The vast majority of the [[people]] employed in this sector are women and such work is undervalued, underpaid and informal.	Female
7094	[[I]] recently read the reminiscences of a Polish [[student]] who took part in a [[student]] exchange in Sarajevo - she did not meet a single foreign [[student]] who was there as part of the exchange who did not like Sarajevo.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb

7097	This proposal, Mr [[President]], should be seen as a first step towards more far reaching [[employee]] influence at EU level as well.	Male,Amb
7098	[[I]] naturally regard this as important, since I share the wish expressed by both Mr [[Collins]] and Mrs [[Dybkjær]] for the tax instrument to be applied.	Amb,Male,Female
7099	The [[Commissioner]] said that his new [[Director-General]] has already had six meetings, but let [[us]] see what action results from those meetings, as the saying goes, ' where is the beef, let us get on with it' .	Male,Amb,Amb
7100	[[I]] agree with [[you]] but numerous [[Members]] have said that when the [[Chair]] sees [[someone]] wishing to make a point of order, he has to take that point of order. [[We]] have to have some clarity.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
7101	Many of [[you]] will have seen last weekend the most recent murder [[victim]] was a young 22-year-old student on his way home.	Amb,Male
7102	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], the Giansily report explains extremely well how part of the reserves of the national central banks will be pooled in the future single currency system and how the relations between those banks and the European Central Bank will be organised in order to manage them.	Male,Amb

7474	[[Christoph Probst]] came rather late into the White Rose as he did not belong to the same [[student]] corps as [[Hans Scholl]], [[Alexander Schmorell]] and [[Willi Graf]], and stayed for the most part in the background, as he had to think of his [[family]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb

7482	The rapporteur, Mr [[Maaten]], has, with good reason, proposed reinforcing that legal basis with a reference to another article, Article 133 on external trade, and furthermore has proposed a series of amendments to some of the articles with the aim of preventing this directive being challenged on the basis of the case-law established by the judgment of the [[Court]] of Justice.

7488	[[I]] would like to express my profound unease at the intolerable behaviour of Vice-President [[Vidal-Quadras]], a member of the Spanish Partido Popular, in giving the floor to his political friend, Mr [[Salafranca]], when under Rule 122 there was no reason for it, while denying me the right to reply to him.	Amb,Male,Male
7489	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[I]] would firstly like to congratulate Mrs [[Torres Marques]] on her magnificent work.	Male,Amb,Amb,Female
7490	Let [[me]] remind [[you]] that those amendments were aimed at creating a common organisation of the market in potatoes for [[human]] consumption, something that is particularly important for Portugal.	Amb,Amb,Amb
7491	[[We]] have the utmost consideration for the personal problems of its [[chairman]], but [[I]] feel that it might have been preferable for the [[delegation]] to have met and been able to debate during these extremely difficult and sensitive months for Israel and the Middle East.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
7492	For example, Mr [[President-in-Office]], [[I]] would expect it to be made clear in the Budget conciliation that [[Parliament]] is continually to be supplied with comprehensive information on the progress of the negotiations, and I would expect a trialogue on the subject to achieve agreement on how [[we]] are to move the Financial Perspective's adjustment procedure forward over the coming months.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
7493	[[I]] would therefore ask you, [[Commission Vice-President]], what the Commission intends to do to make the European [[citizens]] aware that Commissioner [[Diamantopoulou]] is not a fairy or a sorceress who is able to grant wealth to all the citizens but an evil ogre who is doing what the national [[governments]] tell her to.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
7494	A second aspect, and an important one, is the use of names. It is of immense importance to any creative [[artist]] that he should be able to put his name to his work, even if he is a mere cog, a part of the whole.	Male
7495	The honourable [[Members]] are aware that a few days ago [[we]] began to deploy the force. There are now 400 [[soldiers]] in the region.	Amb,Amb,Amb

7497	Madam [[President]], Mr [[Barroso]], [[I]] have just come from the Swedish Parliament where, in the last ten years, every other [[politician]] has been a woman.	Female,Male,Amb,Female
7498	[[We]] know perfectly well that it was your commitment to this war and your close links across the Atlantic that gave [[you]] the edge over other centrist [[candidates]] such as Mr [[Verhofstadt]], for example.	Amb,Amb,Male,Male
7499	The alternative to this approach is not to become indifferent and consequently to resign [[oneself]] to the damage which drugs do to the health of the [[users]] and the nuisance they cause for [[others]], as also do alcohol and nicotine.	Amb,Amb,Amb
7500	Finally, let [[me]] underline the importance of our agreement on research, education and culture.	Amb
7501	In that area too, it is important to ensure that the national markets do not get into the hands of one dominant [[player]] to a disproportionate, and therefore unhealthy, degree.	Amb
7502	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would also like to congratulate our [[rapporteur]] on the perceptiveness she has shown in this matter, and [[we]] fully support her proposal to reject the [[Commission]] proposal.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
7503	– Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[I]] am obliged to Mr [[Sjöstedt]], who negotiated very prudently on behalf of Parliament, and also to the [[Commission]], which lent [[us]] its support in our endeavours to reach a compromise in the Council.	Male,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
7504	[[I]] wish to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, especially Mrs [[Gröner]] and Mrs [[Sartori]], for their committed work on this issue.	Amb,Female,Female
7505	As a [[member]] of the Committee on Culture and Education, I have decided to send a letter to my country’s [[Minister]] for National Education calling for him to take appropriate action faced with these disgraceful acts.	Amb,Male
7506	[[We]] also need to express our solidarity with the Italian [[minister]], who was accompanying her own [[father]], a former Dachau deportee now confined to a wheelchair, in the parade.	Amb,Female,Male
7507	Today [[we]] are assessing the [[candidate]] himself, and, in Mr [[Stark]], the [[Council]] has put forward a strong candidate to succeed Mr [[Issing]].	Amb,Male,Male,Amb,Male

7509	Madam [[President]], [[Members]] have decided to hold a joint debate on the three reports by Mrs [[Morgan]], Mr [[Langen]] and Mr [[Seppänen]].	Female,Amb,Female,Male,Male
7510	It has also been applied in cloning and in experiments to change the genetic heritage of [[individuals]].	Amb
7511	on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[we]] wish to support the [[Commission]] in its bid to encourage collective reflection on flexicurity.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
7512	(PL) Madam [[Chairman]], [[I]] would also like to support the amendments concerning visually impaired [[persons]].	Female,Amb,Amb
7513	in writing. - (EL) The centre-right and centre-left political [[groupings]] are competing with each other over which can lend more support to the interests and choices of big business.	Amb
7514	in writing. - (DE) The report by Mrs [[Gomes]] on the European Union's role in Iraq unfortunately sidesteps the two main issues of relevance to the situation in Iraq.	Female
7515	Female [[prisoners]] belong to a special category; they probably represent a minority of the total number of prisoners in Europe, on average only 5%.	Female
7516	[[Member]] of the Commission. - Madam [[President]], the Commission thanks Parliament, and, in particular, the [[rapporteur]], for his constructive approach.	Amb,Female,Male
7517	This is particularly in the interest of single [[mothers]] because employment opportunities are thereby created and poverty can be combated.	Female
7518	(RO) The strengthening of the European Union's role as an [[actor]] on the international scene is impossible without continuous adjustment to the 21st century global context.	Amb
7519	(The [[President]] interrupted the [[speaker]] to ask her to speak more slowly, at the request of the [[interpreters]])	Amb,Female,Amb

7521	As for [[me]], after the presidium meeting I visited the Érmellék area of Partium.	Amb
7522	That was the choice made today by the European [[Parliament]] which, in adopting Mrs [[Jeggle's]] report, has highlighted the important role that [[women]] will play in the future enhancement of rural areas.	Amb,Female,Female
7523	In this case, the report deals with the rights of migrant and refugee [[women]], who are treated as a select category of women compared to other female European [[citizens]].	Female,Female
7524	[[I]] would also like to congratulate my colleagues, Mrs [[Kalniete]] and Mr [[Correia De Campos]], for their good work.	Amb,Female,Male
7525	[[Anyone]] who is familiar with the situation in Poland, Romania or Spain will understand that coal has to be included as an option in the Energy Roadmap 2050, otherwise they will be ignoring the realities of democratically elected [[parliaments]] and [[governments]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
7526	As a [[representative]] of a southern euro area Member State which is faced with enormous financial problems, his appointment will also send out completely the wrong signal to the markets and our [[citizens]], who do not want a transfer union, but rather a stable currency.	Male,Amb
7527	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], Mr [[Dini]] has just told [[us]] that the [[Heads]] of [[Government]] were particularly concerned about employment.	Male,Female,Male,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
7528	As [[chairman]] of the French National Food Council, I should like to commend the measures taken by our [[minister]] to reassure both [[consumers]] and the [[breeders]] of unaffected [[livestock]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
7529	[[I]] should like to draw [[Members']] attention, on the other hand, to a new element in the ECSC budget.	Amb,Amb
7530	[[We]] must therefore express satisfaction, and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr [[Hyland]], on his excellent work, in terms of its approach and content and also its incorporation of other opinions, in this case that of the [[Committee]] on Regional Policy.	Amb,Male,Amb
7531	Mr [[President]], [[I]] just want to repeat that the [[rapporteur]] maintains all his amendments, especially the rejection of Amendment No 2.	Male,Amb,Male
7532	After that, [[everyone]] can make up their own minds, but under no circumstances can [[I]] deny the right to speak to one our [[colleagues]] who is defending himself from an accusation, and I shall not do so.	Amb,Amb,Male
7533	[[I]] put my trust in the [[Commissioner]] and support her continuing efforts, whilst joining in the praise which has already been expressed.	Amb,Female
7534	Yesterday, Mr [[Hogg]] said, and [[I]] quote: ' There is a strong case for Northern Ireland.	Male,Amb
7535	Mr [[President]], as [[rapporteur]] for last year's budget I would like, first of all, to wish my successor, Mr [[Tillich]], every success and my old friend, Mr [[Tomlinson]] because 1998 is again a crucial year, perhaps not so much in financial terms but for what this budget contributes to progress on the institutional dialogue.	Male,Amb,Male,Male
7536	Mr [[Tamino]], under the Rules of Procedure one [[speaker]] speaks in favour of the motion and one against.	Male,Amb
7537	Mr [[President]], [[I]] should like to ask whether the [[rapporteur]] would accept a verbal amendment to this amendment.	Male,Amb,Amb
7538	Mr [[President]], Mr [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], the closure of the nuclear power station at Chernobyl is an extremely sensitive subject, in the light of the dramatic accident which occurred, and which [[we]] naturally all remember.	Male,Male,Female,Male,Amb
7539	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] believe that the question raised by Mr [[Fabre-Aubrespy]], over and above the strict problem of whether the amendment is in order, is nevertheless a question which should be posed.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Male
7540	Showing the utmost warmth and friendship at all times - as befits loyal [[colleagues]] - the United States has been relentless in the banana panel and the hormone panel. Let [[us]] not be naive.	Amb,Amb
7541	During the meeting in Geneva recently of the UN Commission on Human Rights, [[we]] had the opportunity to speak to a Texan [[attorney]] who opposed the death penalty.	Amb,Amb
7542	If [[I]] could just quote a [[professor]] of medicine who said in twenty years she has never taken up any political activity or lobbying but she is moved to write today to plead because she feels very strongly that advertising bans can reduce the number of [[people]] taking up and continuing smoking.	Amb,Female,Amb
7543	[[I]] am sure that your [[colleagues]] in the Committee on Budgets and [[those]] who take part in the Trialogue will do everything they can together with [[us]] to find a line which could be acceptable for all three [[institutions]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
7544	[[I]] do not want to finish, Mr [[President]], without mentioning that there are some [[Members]] who have some reservations about dedicated reserves, because of the danger of accumulating expenditure at the end of the year and having to pay it all at the same time.	Amb,Male,Amb
7545	International criminal networks certainly call for an international and multi-dimensional response, as the [[Minister]] herself recognised.	Female
7546	Let [[me]] make it quite clear: what I have presented here is the approach of the German [[Government]] and the German [[Chancellor]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
7547	It reminds me of when I was a little Catholic [[boy]] and the religious procession came through the village, all the curtains were open as the image of [[Christ]] and its two candles went by and things were absolutely still, [[you]] could have heard a pin drop.	Male,Male,Amb
7548	[[I]] feel almost as if I am abandoning a [[child]] who has not yet fully recovered from an illness in the middle of the street and wondering [[who]] will take care of him from now on.	Amb,Male,Amb
7549	For how can it be that [[someone]] from France, for instance, goes shopping in Germany, relies on a two-year guarantee but then finds that because he bought the goods in Germany he should have lodged a complaint within two months?	Male
7550	Whether or not that was justified in this particular case is something I as a [[politician]] have a very definite view on.	Amb
7551	The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0016/99) by Mr [[Langen]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the common position adopted by the [[Council]] with a view to adoption of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community (ALTENER) (1998-2002) (7122/1/99 - C5-0032/99 - 97/0370(COD)).

7684	Moreover, [[calves]] over eight weeks should be kept in large pens to foster their natural behaviour as herd animals.	Amb
7685	Against the background of this debate, [[we]] have the recent outburst from the [[leader]] of the governing coalition in Italy who, perhaps trying to hold out too leafy an olive branch, spoke of liberalizing hallucinogenic drugs.	Amb,Amb
7686	Bear in mind that the United States is not a banana-[[producer]] and is representing the interests - doubtless legitimate - of the American [[multinationals]] which trade in the banana-dollar.	Amb,Amb

7692	[[I]] do think, though, that a number of questions remain to be answered, not just the fundamental questions you posed, Mr [[Commissioner]].	Amb,Male
7693	Finally it is important that the [[Agency's]] multi-annual work programme should be complemented by a multi-annual budget in order to enable the Agency to plan its work more effectively.	Amb

7796	[[I]] am thinking of the French [[soldier]] who lost his life at the very time [[we]] were carrying out our mission and also the seventeen brave Spanish [[soldiers]] who died in a helicopter accident, in honour of whom we expressed our gratitude and recognition during our visit to Herat, the base where they had their general headquarters, and also our visit to the [[Governor]], the [[President]], the [[authorities]] of the United Nations, women [[candidates]] and the [[General Head]] of the NATO forces in that country.

7802	(DE) Mr [[President]], Madam [[President-in-Office]] of the Council, [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], speaking as a [[member]] of this House's EU/Moldova group, I would like to return to that problem and make it very plain that this conflict is not about [[minorities]].	Male,Female,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Amb

7804	[[I]] should now like to say a few words on a disturbing moment in these negotiations. Madam [[Chancellor]], our [[generation]], regardless of the part of Germany from which we come, has a duty that we, like all democratic [[politicians]] in our country, try to live up to, namely to draw the right conclusions from our country's mistakes and from the crimes that were committed in our [[people's]] name.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
7805	[[rapporteur]]. - (PT) Madam [[President]], [[Commissioner]], I must firstly thank the [[Members]] who worked very closely with me on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and who helped me with their critical contributions, in particular Mr [[Guardans]], Mr [[Demetriou]] and, last but definitely not least, Mr [[Correia]].	Amb,Female,Amb,Male,Male,Male,Male
7806	[[I]] would like to thank Mrs [[Starkevičiūtfor]] the report and Mr [[Lehne]] and Mrs [[Harms]] for the draft resolution.	Amb,Female,Male,Female
7807	(RO) Mr. [[President]], Madam [[Commissioner]], the reports we debate and for which [[I]] congratulate both [[rapporteurs]] raise a few extremely important questions, in my opinion: that of the partnerships between the urban and the rural areas for the balanced and sustainable development of the overall territory, the issue of the chaotic extension of urban settlements that generate fragmentation of the landscape, as well as the continuous loss of land.	Male,Female,Amb,Amb
7808	in writing. - (PL) In my capacity as a female [[professor]] with many years of experience working in a Polish university, I am aware of the magnitude of the challenges involved and therefore support the report by Mrs [[Thomsen]].	Female,Female
7809	Mrs [[Mathieu]] is quite right to point out that Afghanistan's social indicators are dramatically low.	Female
7810	[[Member]] of the Commission. - (RO) The European Commission considers that Turkey is sufficiently prepared to initiate negotiations on the Energy chapter and therefore recommended for this chapter to be opened in spring 2007.	Amb
7811	[[Patients']] ability to understand health and medical issues and directions is closely related to the clarity of the communication.	Amb
7812	Taking into account what the [[Commissioner]] has said, and the fact that the appropriate [[committee]] voted on these amendments, that is, the appropriate committee and as such, the [[chair]] of the appropriate committee, considered them to be admissible; since he allowed them to be voted on, and also taking into account all that [[we]] have voted on today in relation to Articles 15, 16, and 17, [[I]] note that the directive has changed direction.	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
7813	Shortly before [[we]] were able to vote, when the sitting was suspended for just a short time, a [[Member]] of our honourable House apparently succeeded in smuggling in a parliamentary [[candidate]], having a few cheeky promotional photographs taken with her and, in my view, abusing our Body.	Amb,Amb,Female
7814	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], first of all, [[I]] would like to thank Mrs [[Hedh]] and Mrs [[Bauer]] for their initiative.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Female,Female
7815	Indeed, [[I]] am concerned about the Chinese Communist [[Party's]] interference in the independent operation of the justice system by requesting [[people's]] arrests and rapid convictions.	Amb,Amb,Amb
7816	Even if the [[rapporteur]] does not entirely follow through with her logic, it is refreshing to see that this [[Parliament]] is finally becoming aware of a number of problems.	Female,Amb
7817	(ES) Mr [[President]], let [[us]] not delude ourselves.	Male,Amb
7818	He must be told politely, because he is a [[friend]] who sometimes makes mistakes: he made a mistake with the nuclear testing and he is doing so again with drugs.	Male

7822	[[I]] can honestly say that it breaks my heart to hear or to read that a certain young [[person]], very often having passed his driving test only a few days, or even hours earlier, has lost his life because our [[society]] is not functioning in the way that it should.	Amb,Male,Amb
7823	[[I]] would like to put the following question to [[you]]: the Swedish [[government]] has given official support to a Swedish public [[servant]] working for the Council who has taken a case of discrimination against him and his registered [[partner]] to the Court of Justice.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
7824	[[I]] believe the [[Commission]] has a very good overall picture of the situation, but I am prepared to ask our [[experts]] in the field to provide the honourable [[Member]] with detailed information if she so wishes.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
7825	Madam [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], first of all [[I]] should like to express my sincere thanks to Mr [[Chichester]] for his detailed report, but I should also like to thank the [[Committee]] on Research, Technological Development and Energy for dealing with this report and particularly for their very close cooperation with the various [[departments]] of the [[Commission]], which has done much to promote understanding of the current problems in what is undoubtedly a highly sensitive area.	Female,Female,Male,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
7826	On 23 October this year, after difficult negotiations between Prime Minister [[Netanyahu]] and President [[Arafat]], an agreement was finally reached at Wye Plantation near Washington, largely thanks to the efforts of the United States and President [[Clinton]], but in which King [[Hussein]] also played a crucial role.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male
7827	[[I]] would therefore ask you, [[Commissioner]], to reply jointly to these questions by Mr [[White]], Mrs [[Oddy]] and Mrs [[Kinnock]] in the two minutes which we have left before 7 p.m.	Amb,Amb,Male,Female,Female
7828	Finally, let [[me]] repeat what Mr [[Fernández Martín]] said in his report and welcome the laudable efforts and progress made in many ACP states over the last few years in spite of the difficult economic conditions they face.	Amb,Male
7829	Mr [[President]], Mr [[President-in-Office]] of the Council, except for the fact that you once used the term Agriculture Council you have actually succeeded in speaking for 10 minutes without even once really mentioning the reform of agricultural policy; as the agricultural [[spokesman]] for my [[group]] I do feel a little hurt.

7952	in writing. - (DE) Time and again, Turkey demonstrates that it is not ready for EU membership by oppressing its [[minorities]], by launching air strikes against a neighbouring country and, most recently, by vetoing the appointment of the [[head]] of the Austrian archaeological excavation [[team]] in Ephesus, apparently because of anti-Turkish comments made by a [[member]] of her [[family]].	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
7953	[[rapporteur]]. - (PL) Mr [[President]], I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, namely Mrs [[Sommer]] and Mrs [[Griesbeck]], as well as Mr [[Evans]] and Mrs [[Ţicău]] for their statements, cooperation and support.	Amb,Male,Female,Female,Male,Female
7954	[[rapporteur]]. - Mr [[President]], after our previous debate I am glad to see that we are still friends and that we can reach a wider consensus on these issues.	Amb,Male
7955	[[author]]. - (PL) Mr [[President]], I would not want this to be a debate on the subject of the death penalty as such.	Amb,Male
7956	As [[I]] did not interpret the [[Member's]] speech in the manner in which [[you]] have just claimed, I did not resort to the powers which are conferred on me under the Rules of Procedure.	Amb,Amb,Amb
7957	The [[Minister]] of Agriculture in the Republic of Ireland has shown clearly that he takes care of his own first.	Male
7958	in writing. - (DA) The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament, [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]], [[Britta Thomsen]], [[Christel Schaldemose]], [[Dan Jørgensen]] and [[Ole Christensen]], have abstained from the vote on Mrs [[van den Burg's]] report on reduced rates of value added tax.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
7959	[[I]] appeal to you, [[President]] of the Commission, to make a comprehensive, new recovery effort.	Amb,Amb
7960	If a [[person]] is granted with asylum in a Member State she should have the same rights and obligations as other [[citizens]] in the country.	Female,Amb
7961	The [[authorities]] in Burma have chosen to ignore the protests against the imprisonment of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] and the calls to release her that have been made by a large number of countries and [[organisations]], including the [[Secretary-General]] of the UN, the [[Secretary-General]] of ASEAN and a number of ASEAN Member States, of which Burma is, after all, one.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
7962	In these conclusions, the [[Council]] stressed, and [[I]] quote, that 'the elimination of all forms of violence against the girl [[child]], including trafficking and harmful traditional practices, are crucial for the empowerment of [[girls]] and [[women]], and for the achievement of equality between women and [[men]] in society'.	Amb,Amb,Female,Female,Female,Male
7963	Is not the safety of more than half of all European [[citizens]], in other words female citizens, worth a substantial political investment?	Female
7964	[[I]] do not understand why it is not urgent to take the floor, discussing the issue of the treatment of one of the [[Members]] of this Parliament who has visited a country exercising his right as President of Liberal International.	Amb,Male
7965	Today, [[women]] are highly qualified, but the number of women in executive positions has remained unchanged over the past few years, and yet the number of female [[students]] enrolling in economics, business and law is higher than that of male [[students]].	Female,Female,Male
7966	Any [[state]] which deliberately falsifies its figures must quite simply be ejected from the euro area.	Amb
7967	In this connection, [[I]] congratulate our [[Chair]] on her report, which points out that the control scheme adopted by the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) must be transposed into European law without delay; more specifically, I welcome the introduction of the programme promoting compliance by non-contracting [[party]] vessels.	Amb,Female,Amb
7968	[[I]] think that [[we]] need to create the basis for implementing specific measures and political strategies to broaden young [[people's]] access to education, for example, through grants or [[student]] loans and subsidies.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
7969	However, [[we]] do not believe that [[MEPs]] need more [[staff]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
7970	(SK) Madam [[President]], [[I]] would like to begin by supporting the efforts of the [[rapporteur]] to launch a debate in the European Parliament on the media environment.	Female,Amb,Amb
7971	Lastly, the proposal sets an example to those countries for which pharmaceuticals represent a necessary item of expenditure if they are to guarantee a future for the younger [[generations]], and a call to take a stance in favour of the adoption of development and wealth creation policies.	Amb
7972	Thus, [[I]] have to agree with the [[rapporteur]], and hope that her recommendations, particularly with regard to certainty of information and the precautionary principle - which needs to benefit [[patients]] rather than [[companies]] - are taken into account by the [[Commission]] and by all Member States.

7973	The disregard for [[women]] has reached peak levels when a German [[judge]] refers to the [[husband's]] right of procreation as a decisive factor in her judgment in a Muslim divorce case.	Female,Female,Male
7974	The question that was raised by several [[speakers]], the first being Mr [[Groote]] and then Mr [[Häfner]], concerned the mandatory register.	Male,Male,Male
7975	The [[candidate]] fulfils the conditions laid down in Article 286(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and his curriculum vitae shows a series of high-level positions in financial management and budgetary control in public [[institutions]] and private enterprises.

7976	Mr [[Dankert]], [[I]] listened carefully to the [[rapporteur]], especially as he spoke in my language so there was no possible interpreting error.	Male,Amb,Male
7977	The new Member States have brought about a notable improvement in this situation: 41 % of those selected as [[heads]] of department and/or central [[advisers]] were [[women]], whereas the old Member States only achieved 15 %.	Female,Female,Female
7978	So [[I]] think there has to be a fundamental rethink which encourages enterprise and rewards effort and one which has to deal with, as the honourable [[Member]] said, some of the structural problems which exist.	Amb,Amb
7979	Moreover, it also makes it possible for American damage claims to be removed from the jurisdiction of any [[judge]] in the Member States.	Amb
7980	But it was Mrs [[Green]] who initiated this shambles.	Female
7981	A [[child]] who, today, is allowed neither the time nor the circumstances to be a child - to play, study and grow up with other [[children]] and his own [[family]] - will sooner or later become a dissatisfied adult, perhaps a violent one, one who robs and kills...	Male,Amb,Amb
7982	Last week [[I]] accompanied the Prime Minister, Mr [[Junker]], to Ukraine, within the context of a visit linked both to the European Union/Ukraine summit and to bilateral relations.	Amb,Male
7983	So let [[me]] share with [[you]] a heartfelt letter which I received from a football [[fan]] from Aberdeen, in my constituency. He says, ' I write to you in the hope that the European Parliament can do something about the ridiculous ticket allocations for the World Cup finals in France.	Amb,Amb,Male
7984	Mrs [[Izquierdo Rojo]], that is not a point of order.	Female
7985	[[I]] suggest that I talk to my colleague, Mr [[Liikanen]], and that [[we]] undertake to make a proposal to the [[Council]] for a significant increase in the present percentage, which is 3.5 %.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
7986	And [[I]] have to say to the [[Minister]] responsible, who is here in his capacity as President-in-Office, that he cannot stand back and idly watch the agriculture industry disappear and take the hammering it has been taking because of the strong pound and issues over which the [[farmer]] has no control.	Amb,Male,Amb
7987	[[I]] beg your pardon, Madam [[President]], but Rule 112(5), also says that you, as President, can establish whether there are actually 29 [[people]] here in the Chamber.	Amb,Female,Amb
7988	The numbers of [[patients]] will be far in excess of the [[doctors]] available, who are mostly male.	Amb,Male
7989	This question was first discussed at the meeting with [[directors]] of sports organisations in the Member States held in Vienna on 7 and 8 October; it was again discussed at a meeting with the Austrian, British and German sports [[ministers]], and it was also considered at the European Sports Forum, which brings together governmental and non-governmental organisations and sports federations; the [[director]] of the International Olympic Committee and the [[head]] of the French Minister for Sport's private office also took part in this meeting.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
7990	And finally, [[I]] would like to say that I was very pleasantly surprised when the Council [[representative]] said in his statement this morning that the Amsterdam Treaty had given the European Parliament important new rights and powers, and when he added that he could see the next IGC granting the European Parliament an even more important role in the appointment of the [[Commission]] than is provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty.

8111	The impact of isolation and distress on female [[prisoners]], in particular on [[mothers]] and pregnant [[women]], can have harmful consequences for the mother herself but also, mainly, for her [[child]] and his or her development.	Female,Female,Female,Amb
8112	Moreover, [[people]] are not even allowed to ask questions about such matters, as was shown by the recent attack by [[Vladimir Putin]] on a female [[journalist]] from Niezavisima Gazieta, which reduced the woman to tears.	Amb,Amb,Female
8113	As a [[representative]] from London - and, indeed, a woman representative from London - I have had a particular interest in this subject, because London is one of the places very much affected by trafficking in [[women]].	Female,Female
8114	As you said, Mr [[Chair]], you would not like to be rude.	Male
8115	[[I]] believe that, just like any other European [[citizen]], [[those]] living in Moldova should also enjoy the rights which derive from their political status.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8116	Mr [[President]], like many [[mothers]], [[I]] want decent [[animal]] welfare standards but I also want affordable eggs.	Male,Female,Female,Amb
8117	The disregard for [[women]] has reached peak levels when a German [[judge]] refers to the [[husband's]] right to use corporal punishment anchored in the Koran as a decisive factor in her judgment on a Muslim divorce case.	Female,Female,Male
8118	Through today's resolution [[Parliament]] grants the [[Director]] of the European Environment Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009.	Amb,Amb
8119	Madam [[President]], honourable [[Members]], [[we]] are aware that the [[Commission]] has little room for manoeuvre.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
8120	The strong [[states]] should unite to form a new monetary union and the [[others]] should return to their own currencies.	Amb,Amb
8121	In Mrs [[van Dijk's]] statement yesterday, she gave the reasons for the position of the majority of the [[group]].	Female,Amb
8122	As regards the last question from Mrs [[van Putten]] on falconry, my understanding is that the drafting of special rules in this area is not being considered.	Female
8123	The basic principle of that directive is that the host Member State must permit a Community [[citizen]] to carry on a profession within its territory even if he is not in possession of the national diploma required for that purpose, provided that he is in possession of the diploma required in a different Member State in order to embark upon or carry on the same profession.	Male
8124	Mr [[President]], there are approximately 37 million disabled [[people]] in the European Union, about 10 % of the total EU [[population]].	Male,Amb,Amb
8125	The next item is the report (A4-0206/97) by Mr [[Cox]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a [[Council]] Decision authorizing Member States to continue to apply to certain mineral oils, when used for specific purposes, existing reduced rates of excise duty or exemptions from excise duty, in accordance with the procedure provided in Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81/EEC (COM(96)0549 - C4-0071/97-96/0263(CNS))	Male,Amb,Amb
8126	[[I]] should say that with that amendment in particular, [[Commissioner]], it becomes possible for the Commission on the basis of Article 139 to clarify the issue of discretionary power, as you said. However, in the Financial Regulation it must be established as a general principle that mainly in case of subdelegation the [[person]] who accepts the subdelegation cannot exercise it at his own discretion, whatever that may be.	Amb,Amb,Male
8127	Mr [[President]], [[I]] wish to begin by congratulating the [[Commissioner]] on his position with the proposals, of course, as always to protect [[consumer]] health.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb
8128	My question, which is on structural funds and eligibility for structural funds, has been put down under 'Any Other Questions' , and yet earlier in the afternoon Mrs [[Wulf-Mathies]], the Regional Affairs Commissioner, is answering questions.	Female
8129	Madam [[Minister]], Mr [[President]], the objective of improving the competitiveness of our industry, as set out by the [[Minister]], has the consequence of lowering the cost of work and trade liberalization, which will have serious consequences on employment within the European Union as a whole.	Female,Male,Amb
8130	What is good for the financial markets is not good for [[them]].	Amb
8131	First of all [[I]] would like to thank my [[colleague]] for her response to my letter about the Parliament magazine and to say that the article was in fact subsequently printed in full: I am satisfied with that.	Amb,Female
8132	Firstly, the [[victim]] must no longer apply to an [[insurer]] in the other country; he can apply to a [[representative]] of this insurer in his own country, which means that all insurers in the European Union are obliged to have a [[representative]] in all other countries of the European Union who can deal with the claims.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
8133	The first is that it involves the violent death of a young [[person]] who had come to the European Union seeking protection against the moral injustice being forced on her in her own country in the name of tradition. The second - that is equally important - is the fact that the methods used by the [[police]] were perfectly legal, even though they were not only violent but also degrading.	Female,Amb
8134	Mr [[President]], first [[I]] want to express the support of the Green Group for this resolution from the [[members]] of the GUE Group. Our support also reiterates the commitment of the Greens to sending a tangible signal of support from the European Parliament to the Kurdish [[people]], through [[Leyla Zana]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
8135	[[I]] do not think that [[schools]] wishing to take part should have to submit a plan.	Amb,Amb
8136	[[I]] think I can say that the [[Commission]] to a large extent agrees with the [[rapporteur's]] analysis, and his conclusions too.	Amb,Amb,Male
8137	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] should firstly like to congratulate the [[rapporteur]] on his report and on the level of consensus reached in the House, which is something that has not been easy.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Male
8138	It is my very great pleasure to cordially welcome Mr [[Dehaene]] who does [[us]] the honour of attending in the [[visitors']] gallery to hear our debates prior to his own statement on Wednesday.	Male,Amb,Amb

8207	During his first visit to England as an exchange [[student]] in 1983, [[he]] discovered the British youth culture and the local fashion and music magazines of the time.	Male,Male
8208	Since 1972 he has been a [[professor]] at Rutgers University.	Male
8209	It was long believed that this sentence was carried out, and that [[she]] was the last [[person]] executed for sorcery in Germany.	Female,Female
8210	As a [[friend]] of [[Wiseman]], [[Newman]], [[Montalambert]], [[W. G. Ward]], and other eminent [[Catholics]], he was intimately acquainted with the various interests of the Church, and his parliamentary position was often of great advantage to the Church.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb

8216	As a [[teenager]] during high school, she spent a year as an exchange student in Germany.	Female
8217	If, nonetheless, the [[rapporteur]] takes the view today that these cases have not been solved properly, then [[I]] would like to side with her fully and unreservedly, as did the [[Committee]] on Budgetary Control with just one vote against.	Female,Amb,Amb
8218	In several of the African countries which [[I]] recently visited, I was informed that in order to have one [[teacher]], the colleges must train three, because by the age of 30 so many teachers are already dead from AIDS.	Amb,Amb

8220	Now, on 13 February, the European Parliament voted on a resolution that was subject to a vote by roll-call, and it appears that Mr [[Nassauer]] is recorded as having voted in favour of this resolution.	Male
8221	At Bergamo Orio al Serio airport, as [[I]] was leaving to come to Strasbourg, I met a [[pensioner]] - a very old lady who is 80 years old - who told me that she wanted to go to Paris to visit her [[daughter]] but that she could not do so because she would lose her Italian State pension which is her only means of support.	Amb,Female,Female
8222	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], the policy of the Group of the Party of European Socialists is for every female [[citizen]] of the EU to have access to decision-making processes at local, regional, national and European level.	Male,Female,Male,Female
8223	Mrs [[Theato]] has the floor for a point of order.	Female
8224	[[I]] wonder whether Commissioner [[Lamy]] would be able to predict that other countries such as the US or Japan might be prepared to follow his excellent lead.	Amb,Male
8225	[[I]] ask [[Members]] of this Parliament what they would think if a [[lawyer]] had a suspicion that his [[client]] was preparing some money laundering activity?	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
8226	Madam [[President]], last month in San Sebastian a booby-trapped toy seriously injured a [[baby]] in the arms of his [[grandmother]] who was killed by the explosion.	Female,Male,Female
8227	This proves that a) he has a conscience and b) he is also a campaign [[leader]].	Male
8228	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[I]] would like, on behalf of our [[group]], to thank Mrs [[De Sarnez]], who has drafted an excellent report.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
8229	[[I]] would remind the [[Commissioner]] not to personalise debates in the way he did - although there was an element of humour about this - because I represent the views of the [[committee]] and the amendment he referred to was adopted unanimously by my group.	Amb,Male,Amb
8230	[[I]] would like to repeat that there should not be an aim here to reduce road transport but rather reduce its adverse effects, because if a [[patient]] is sick [[you]] will certainly not cure him by killing him off, but by giving him the proper medicine.	Amb,Male,Amb
8231	The [[President]] of the Court of [[Auditors]] confirmed this to [[me]] and [[you]] have just heard Commissioner [[Monti]] say that the [[Commission]], too, is satisfied with this agreement, which will be renegotiated and renewed.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
8232	[[I]] feel it is essential that the so-called principle of 'non-discrimination', which states that a temporary [[worker]] should not be treated less favourably than a similar [[worker]] in the [[company]] using him from the point of view of working and employment conditions should be applied fully and therefore without 'discrimination'!	Amb,Male,Male,Amb
8233	What [[we]] need to scrap, [[Commissioner]], are not fishing boats, but old oil tankers.	Amb,Amb
8234	[[I]] therefore call upon the non-Italian [[Members]] as well to see this as a question of the legal protection of typical products.	Amb,Amb
8235	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would firstly like to congratulate Mrs [[Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou]] on her work, this Parliament's [[Committee]] on Women[[']]s Rights and Equal Opportunities for the excellent work it has been doing and the European Commission, in relation to equal opportunities policy.	Male,Amb,Female,Amb,Female
8236	[[Madam President]], [[I]] should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr [[Grosch]], for his excellent cooperation both during the first reading and now during the second reading.	Female,Amb,Male
8237	You have the resources, [[Commissioner]], but for goodness sake let [[us]] ensure that they go to the heart of our present-day [[society]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
8238	If [[one]] were to look at this solely from the point of view of the safety of [[human beings]], one would have to demand immediate rebuilding, with bi-directional tunnels and so on. If, though, one considers these things in relation to costs – which one also has to do – then a new middle way has to be found.	Amb,Amb
8239	The same criterion applies to your second question; that is, when extradition by a Member State is requested of a [[person]] for a crime of which he has already been convicted by that Member State.	Male
8240	Picking up on the comments of Commissioner [[Piebalgs]], whom [[I]] naturally welcome here this evening, I should like to console the Commission for the way in which [[we]] and the [[Council]] have cut back its text and therefore some of the proposed powers that were envisaged, which we deem unnecessary.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
8241	The [[Commission]] has also been actively involved in the work of the high-level [[group]] on cross-border healthcare and [[patient]] mobility with a view to establishing how best the framework for guaranteeing and promoting patient rights in the single market can be developed.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8242	It was impossible to help the [[victim]] because she was given three days’ notice to leave the country.	Female
8243	The [[victim]] is forced to hand over her earnings either directly or through a third [[party]].	Female,Amb
8244	[[I]] should like to ask the [[President]] of Parliament to send a goodwill message to the [[Speaker]] of that Assembly in view of the difficult role and task she has ahead of her.	Amb,Amb,Female
8245	With the official purpose of providing security for elections, 2 000 EU [[soldiers]] are to be deployed in the Congo, yet [[we]] know – and the German defence [[minister]] has himself said – what this is actually all about; it is actually all about safeguarding Germany’s and the EU's economic interests, and now – or so [[I]] see from the plan – the Sudan is the next country to get the treatment, this time with NATO involvement.	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
8246	In the EU, Mr [[Sterckx]], the cross-border distinction is irrelevant, and until the EU gravy train finally hits the buffers, it is all unstoppable.	Male
8247	The proposal also aims at ensuring that information on new methods able to detect [[cat]] and [[dog]] fur and to distinguish it from other types of fur is made available to the [[Commission]] and exchanged between Member States.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8248	A second convention was drawn up stipulating that the consent of the [[prisoner]] was not required, but this convention was not signed by all the Member States of the Council of Europe, and thus the attempt foundered.	Amb
8249	[[I]] would like to say that [[adult]] education has always been one of the best ways both to effect social and economic development and to contribute to better wealth distribution.	Amb,Amb
8250	The European Union needs to exert as much pressure as possible so that Syria and Iran cease to hinder the resolution of the political conflict in Lebanon and support the Arab League's proposal on the election of a new [[President]].	Amb
8251	(BG) Mr. [[President]], [[Members]] of the European Parliament, In ten days, on 14 June 2008, Bulgaria will pay tribute to the memory and life work of [[Alexander Stamboliiski]], statesman, reformer and leader of the agrarian movement in the country.	Male,Amb,Male
8252	Finally, if you would permit [[me]], Madam [[President]], I would like to allude to the fact that - while not wishing to offend those male [[Members]] who are also present and indeed I would thank them for their contributions - it has mainly been the female [[Members]] of this House who have spoken this morning and I see in this situation not a problem but rather an opportunity and perhaps also a sign of hope.	Amb,Female,Male,Female
8253	Mr [[Barrot]] spoke today about non-discrimination.	Male
8254	Thirdly, the compromise confirms that the option must always be provided to refer a case to a [[judge]], an independent and impartial court, whose decision must be respected.	Amb
8255	Not all of [[us]] had a referendum and the opportunity to give our views on the future development of Europe, yet there are things happening across the EU that have a direct impact on our work in facing the challenges before us and all of those policy issues that have already been mentioned - employment, social rights, economic regulation, fighting terrorism, peace and justice - and I am proud to speak, incidentally, as [[chair]] of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in Wales.	Amb,Amb
8256	[[I]] believe it is time to have a Brussels for the environment, bringing all of the social [[partners]] and the major [[representatives]] of the environmental organisations together around one table.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8257	[[Member]] of the Commission. - Mr [[President]], as the [[rapporteur]] pointed out, the aim of this proposal is to facilitate movement within the Schengen area for third-country [[nationals]] who are legally residing in one of the Member States on the basis of a long-stay or 'D' visa.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
8258	(DE) Mr [[President]], thank you, Commissioner [[Malmström]].	Male,Amb
8259	Although more than 21 000 seats on local [[councils]] were being contested, there were only an estimated 360 opposition [[candidates]] competing against the pro-government [[candidates]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
8260	[[I]] want to thank especially my colleague, [[Petra Kammerevert]], and, above all, [[Doris Pack]], because she is the mother of this initiative.	Amb,Amb,Female
8261	[[We]] have constructed an impressive framework of high-level interactions where we regularly address the global challenges that our [[citizens]] are facing without, however, neglecting the issues where our views may differ.	Amb,Amb
8262	Having got the power back, [[we]] should copy the [[Swiss]] in their system of localism and direct democracy and push powers down to the lowest practicable level.	Amb,Amb
8263	Even in the case of the governance package that my colleague, Mr [[Rehn]], and [[I]] presented, the Member States were not willing to accept the initial level of ambition.	Male,Amb
8264	Then Mrs [[Green]] spoke against.	Female
8265	This report sets out the work carried out not by the [[committee]] as a whole - that would not be accurate - but an active core, with the task of monitoring with rigour and out of a sense of service, [[I]] would say, presided over with authority and with rigour by Mr [[Newman]].	Amb,Amb,Male
8266	It is not my intention to speak about the first two aspects, since these have been discussed in previous interventions. [[I]] shall restrict my contribution to the third aspect, which is the subject of Mr [[Herman's]] report which [[we]] are debating today.	Amb,Male,Amb
8267	The BEUC (the European Bureau of Consumers' Unions) has congratulated the European [[Parliament]], which has been much more demanding about labelling than the [[Council]], and [[I]] wish in my turn to thank and congratulate Mrs [[Roth-Behrendt]] for her work.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
8268	It still has work to do and [[I]] am sure that Mrs [[Gradin]] will confirm that.	Amb,Female
8269	But in particular [[I]] want to thank the [[rapporteur]] and the [[Committee]] on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, because [[we]] find most of the amendments they have tabled acceptable and think they improve the proposal which, I believe, was fairly good in the first place, taken as a whole - as Mrs [[Schleicher]] rightly pointed out.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
8270	As an extreme case [[one]] might cite Italy, where one the country's political [[leader]] had in his possession important electronic media.	Amb,Male
8271	Mr [[President]], Madam [[Commissioner]], [[I]] would like from the outset to make my own contribution, of course, to the concert of congratulations directed at Mrs [[Quisthoudt]], and I do so the more willingly as what I am preparing to say will not always make very agreeable listening.	Male,Female,Amb,Female
8272	[[I]] should like to congratulate the [[rapporteur]] on the effort she put into producing the report, and on the broad consensus emerging from today's presentation to the [[House]], all of which leads [[us]] to support the report without any reservations or difficulties.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
8273	As far as wine is concerned, and specifically regarding the amendments that have been presented - which Commissioner [[Fischler]] says will be difficult to accept because tomorrow there will be the organic reform of the wine sector - [[I]] would just like to stress the importance of the problem.	Amb,Amb
8274	With regard to the specific issue in hand, concerning the fires in Greece first of all, [[I]] would like to agree with my [[colleagues]] and to ask the [[Commission]] whether it plans to exert the necessary pressure, which it has the obligation to exert, on the Greek [[government]] concerning this famous land registry, which does not exist and which causes Greece to burn every year. I would also like to ask whether, given its powers, it plans to exert pressure on the Greek government to prevent the extensive fires that burn at the hands of [[landgrabbers]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
8275	Perhaps the [[Commissioner]] can come back to this and explain exactly what he meant.	Male
8276	The Group of the Party of European Socialists is proposing that Mrs [[Palacio Vallelersundi's]] report on the quality of the drafting of legislative texts and Mr [[Cot's]] report on 'Better lawmaking 1997' should be taken as a joint debate.	Female,Male
8277	The Loyalist [[Paramilitaries]], the UVF, the UDA and the Republican [[Paramilitaries]], the IRA are all at this.	Amb,Amb
8278	A few weeks ago, when crossing Rue Wiertz, [[I]] was stopped by a [[person]] who asked me point-blank what she had to do to get access to the European Parliament library.	Amb,Female
8279	The [[leader]] of my [[group]] has told [[us]] that she has withdrawn the motion of censure submitted by the Socialist Group.	Female,Amb,Amb
8280	[[We]] should not forget this, despite our disappointment that there was not a majority in favour of the motion of censure. It means that the CDU/CSU [[Members]] in this House made the right decision.	Amb,Amb
8281	[[I]] would like to thank Mr [[Virgin]] - albeit in his absence - for his report.	Amb,Male
8282	To include the [[student]] population of EU applicant countries and certain other countries close to [[us]] in the programme is a natural step towards an enlarging Europe.	Amb,Amb
8283	[[I]] would now propose, contrary to our usual practice, that [[we]] begin with the opinion drawn up by Mrs [[Estevan Bolea]], to whom I now give the floor for two minutes, during which our [[rapporteur]] will no doubt join us.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
8284	On 6 and 7 April, 25 civilian [[victims]] of the armed militia known as the 'Meraputi' were killed with the active connivance of the mobile brigade of Indonesia's elite police squad.	Amb
8285	One of the advantages of this report is that it has prevented [[us]] from giving in to the temptation that entraps many a [[politician]] on the eve of an election, namely giving into the [[people's]] demands.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8286	However, [[you]] have on board a [[candidate]] who has been implicated in a matter regarding a donation in his home country and about whom [[we]] must, since yesterday, ask whether he has made an appropriate statement in the hearings before this [[Parliament]].	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
8287	The unqualified derogation for benzene levels, referred to by Mrs [[Breyer]] for socio-economic reasons, at first seems bizarre. [[One]] would have thought that [[communities]] living in our disadvantaged areas, with all their associated health problems, would be those most in need of cleaner air.	Female,Amb,Amb

8335	The Soviet Military [[Administration]] in Germany initially opposed the idea because they took it for granted that the Communist [[Party]] would, under their guidance, develop into the strongest political force in the Soviet occupation zone.	Amb,Amb

8371	[[Peter]] should then leave, explaining he has a [[girlfriend]] he has recently hardly had time to see.	Male,Female
8372	Mr [[President]], [[I]] agree with the positive evaluation Mrs [[Junker]] has just made and I want to add that Mr [[Corrie]] has started his term as Co-President of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly with effective and impartial work deserving of our full appreciation.	Male,Amb,Female,Male
8373	I am a great [[fan]] of voluntary quotas on electoral lists, without which, in fact, I would not be here today.	Amb
8374	What is more - and [[I]] have skated over this aspect in my report, but Mrs [[Lucas]] has drafted a report on the environment which deals with this at length - [[we]] need to acknowledge that there are limits.	Amb,Female,Amb
8375	In addition, it is important to recognise the [[family]] of the [[victim]] as fellow victims and as witnesses, and to recognise the right to be assisted by an [[interpreter]] and to be questioned in the mother tongue. A special system should also be set up for the legal, psychological and physical protection of [[victims]] of domestic violence, stalking and genital mutilation.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
8376	Although I am merely the temporary [[President]] for this sitting, I have given instructions that the security services and the President of Parliament, Mrs [[Fontaine]], be advised.	Amb,Female
8377	It is clear, furthermore, that while lifelong training must become a reality, nonetheless even at the stage of basic education, in what Mr [[Seppänen]] called general education, it must be taken into account in order to ensure that every school [[pupil]] is motivated and has the necessary skills to learn in the various situations he will find himself in as an adult.	Male,Male
8378	Mr [[President]], when [[I]] started out in politics some thirty years ago, and I went along to the preliminary meeting of the Mexico World Conference on Women, which took place in New York, I accompanied the only female [[diplomat]] our country had at the time.	Male,Amb,Female
8379	[[I]] agree with the [[rapporteur]], too, that the post-Nice agenda should include finding a new approach to the EU' s commercial policy.	Amb,Amb
8380	[[I]] wish to begin by thanking the honourable [[Member]] for his question.	Amb,Male
8381	[[I]] also want to thank the [[rapporteur]] for the work she has done, even if I have not always understood the path she has chosen, the course she has subsequently charted and why the end result appears not to reflect the original, higher ambitions.	Amb,Female
8382	As regards Community fraud and judicial matters, it would be preferable and far more judicious to have recourse to Eurojust. This is a structure of intergovernmental cooperation within the Council and is made up of three [[officers]] from each of the fifteen Member States of the European Union: one [[judge]], one [[representative]] from the Public [[Prosecutor' s]] Office (prosecutor) and one [[police superintendent]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
8383	And this is where the problem arises and this is where [[I]] should like to say to Mr [[Patten]]: Commissioner, that there is a [[member]] here who constantly and dogmatically supports the position of the KLA is, if you will, only natural.	Amb,Male,Amb
8384	Mr [[President]], a [[friend]] of [[mine]] lives with AIDS and so does his [[wife]] because he received contaminated blood in a transfusion and then unknowingly affected his wife.	Male,Male,Amb,Female
8385	The problem has been raised on numerous occasions by this House, by Mrs [[Schleicher]] as Chairperson of the delegation with those countries.	Female
8386	For this, you, Mr [[Maystadt]], and your [[colleagues]] deserve our recognition.	Male,Amb
8387	Second, the establishment during 2002 - and [[I]] know this is a point on which the honourable [[Member]] has himself laid great emphasis - of a solid statistical basis allowing DAC sectoral classification of programmes and projects from 2002.	Amb,Male
8388	It is those kinds of skills that [[we]] sorely miss now that she is ex-[[chairman]] of the Committee on Legal Affairs.	Amb,Female
8389	Madam [[President]], [[Commissioners]], the reports by Mr [[Trakatellis]] and Mrs [[Scheele]] belong together and a great deal has already been said about that in today's debate.	Female,Amb,Male,Female
8390	He is a sad [[figure]] who tries to have complete control over the law.	Male
8391	In his introduction Commissioner [[Solbes]] talked about sustainable growth, which is not the same as sustainable development - some growth can destroy the environment and jobs and is not particularly sustainable.	Male
8392	[[Ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], when a few months or rather a couple of years ago, [[we]] watched the destruction of the [[Buddha]] statues by the [[Taliban]] on our televisions, we said, who do they think they are, destroying the history of [[mankind]]?	Female,Male,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
8393	Having accused three [[men]] of rape, [[she]] was taken into custody as long ago as October, accused of relations sexuelles adulterines - extra-marital sexual intercourse - a bizarre interpretation of the law that degrades the [[victim]] still further and gets her jailed into the bargain.	Male,Female,Female
8394	Because a Dutch [[person]] can go and work in France more easily, he suddenly feels like a European citizen.	Male
8395	[[I]] suggest that [[colleagues]] who feel strongly about this sign all of them.	Amb,Amb
8396	[[I]] know that the [[Commissioner]] has a healthy scepticism of my interest in budget quotas, but the 15% identified in his own programming guidelines should provide a firm baseline in the budget for non-state [[actor]] participation - 85% for governance seems not an unduly small amount.	Amb,Male,Amb
8397	– [[Ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], before beginning the vote, [[I]] give the floor to Mr [[Zappalà]] for a proposal on an issue that [[we]] did not resolve at the beginning of yesterday’s sitting, that is when to vote on his report: on Thursday here in Strasbourg, or during the part-session in Brussels, taking into consideration, however, the fact that, according to our agenda, the debate on this issue is in any event planned for Thursday morning.	Female,Male,Amb,Male,Amb
8398	Finally, [[I]] wish to express my gratitude to my [[friend]], the High Representative, for what he said which – to borrow a remark – my [[father]] would have greatly enjoyed and my [[mother]] would have believed.	Amb,Male,Male,Female
8399	That is in itself a good enough reason to punish [[him]] and deny him a second chance of leadership; the attempt to get rid of him by reason of his Japanese background has far less to commend it.	Male
8400	An [[expert]] whose opinion [[I]] sought about the [[van den Berg]] report told me, the day before yesterday, that it was an outstanding one, and that he hoped the Dutch [[Government]] would adopt it without amendment.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
8401	[[draftsman]] of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (DE) Mr [[President]], Madam [[Minister]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], for the first time, agricultural research is getting a chapter to itself within the context of support for research.	Male,Male,Female,Amb,Female,Male
8402	In comparison with the current situation, where the invitation from the Russian [[host]] needs to be validated, this is, [[I]] think, a great improvement for a large category of [[citizens]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
8403	After a two-year period of reflection, the majority of the states and [[citizens]] came out in favour of forging ahead towards Europe's future.	Amb
8404	[[Chancellor]], [[I]] would also like to have one area of clarification on the point about the wide reports that the pursuit by the EU of free and undistorted competition has been undermined in the draft mandate for the IGC.	Amb,Amb
8405	(PT) Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] must thank and congratulate Mr [[Stockmann]] for his openness and capacity to achieve compromise between the various interests involved in the preparation of this high-quality report, particularly with regard to the outermost regions.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Male
8406	This is so-called "light" industry, where most of the [[workers]] are women, and wages are also low because there are supposedly no risks involved.	Female
8407	Geographic location is an important factor: it can, for example, make it easier for female [[prisoners]] to maintain [[family]] ties and friendships and take part in religious services.	Female,Amb
8408	The one approach does not, however, exclude the other and it sets a quite exceptional educational example to young [[people]] to see a [[nation]] deciding to extend its aid commitment to Africa, to open up to Africa, because it expresses values that are both European in the deepest sense and also universal.	Amb,Amb
8409	(The [[speaker]] continued in English)	Amb
8410	(NL) Congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr [[Van Hecke]], for a good report.	Male
8411	[[I]] just want to ask the [[Minister]] whether he has a view as regards the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was annexed to the Lisbon Treaty.	Amb,Male
8412	[[We]] call on the [[authorities]] in Burma to abolish the bans on peaceful activities and to free political [[prisoners]] immediately.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8413	So, here [[we]] have one of the [[champions]] of the euro expressing his concern for the EU and the euro in the run-up to the recent summit.	Amb,Male
8414	As a social-[[democrat]], I believe that this is an excellent initiative for transferring to national parliaments the positive model offered by the EP on gender equality (11% of the [[members]] of the Romanian parliament are women).	Amb,Female
8415	[[author]]. - [[Madam President]], Iran is notorious for its human rights record, as was noted just yesterday during the debate on the human rights situation in the world.	Amb,Female
8416	[[We]] know that for five weeks [[she]] was denied access to a [[lawyer]].	Amb,Female,Amb
8417	[[President]] of the [[Commission]]. - Not only did the letter have my support but before Mrs [[Kroes]] sent the letter, I told her to send a letter, so my position on those issues is very clear.	Amb,Amb,Female
8418	It brings together both [[Member]] and non-[[Member]] States of the European Union and regional cooperation in the Danube Region provides a very good basis and conditions for cooperation so that these non-Member States integrate into the Union.	Amb,Amb
8419	[[President]] of the Commission. - As you said, Mr [[Karas]], there is no decision yet.	Amb,Male
8420	[[author]]. - Mr [[President]], it is not because it is summertime and [[we]] are all cross.	Amb,Male,Amb
8421	Why can [[we]] accept a Europe that sanctions Member States when they are financially not in line with EU rules and agreements but we cannot accept a Europe that sanctions Member States that neglect gender equality and compose [[governments]] with few or no women [[ministers]]?	Amb,Amb,Female
8422	[[They]] show a [[person]] who is unbowed by years of isolation, leaving [[us]] in no doubt that she will continue to campaign for democratic change in her country.	Amb,Female,Amb
8423	Nevertheless, [[I]] would like to single out a few aspects: firstly, given that the Youth on the Move initiative aims to achieve the principal goal set in the Europe 2020 strategy of reducing the number of [[people]] leaving school without qualifications from 15% to 10%, it lacks measures and recommendations oriented towards raising [[teacher]] competences, qualifications or professional prestige.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8424	[[Virgin]] recommendation	Amb
8425	Mr [[President]], Mr President-in-Office of the Council [[Mitchell]], the [[Commission]] is naturally very concerned about the increase in tension in northern Iraq and the humanitarian situation caused by the recent military conflicts.	Male,Male,Amb
8426	[[I]] would like in this case to lend my support to our [[colleague]] the rapporteur for his proposals which aim to set up European work [[councils]] with responsibility for careful examination of restructuring and relocations.	Amb,Male,Amb
8427	Another word in reply to a group of [[Members]] of Parliament, particularly Mr [[McCartney]], Mr [[McMahon]] and Mr McCartin, who raised the problem of salmon.	Male,Male,Male
8428	If training courses and the granting of diplomas are regulated in this way, [[patients]] in the European Union will be protected, and will be able to decide for themselves [[whom]] they trust and [[who]] they wish to treat them.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8429	Matters relating to social security, the [[employer]]-[[employee]] relationship, taxation and accommodation should be dealt with in a uniform way so that the conditions for freedom of movement can really be secured.	Amb,Amb

8577	[[Everyone]] who spoke, even the rapporteur Mrs [[Dührkop]], whom [[I]] do not see here to congratulate - it seems that she too became bored and has left the House - was disappointed with the budget. At the end of his speech Mr [[Samland]] said the same thing, and all of [[you]] who have spoken said the same, but you will then vote for the budget, you will vote for it as you did last year and the year before.	Amb,Female,Amb,Male,Amb

8579	There are those such as [[Shimon Peres]] or some of his [[colleagues]] in the Labour Party who really do follow a clear political line in that respect, and that is why [[we]] should now express the hope that the Israeli side will declare unequivocally that it desires peace and that it will now halt the various repressive measures which have been taking place with regrettable regularity since the seizure of power and since the appointment of Mr [[Netanyahu]] as Prime Minister will now stop.

8660	Mr [[President]], before we begin our discussion, as an Italian [[MEP]] - and I believe I also speak on behalf of all Italian [[MEPs]] - I should like to condemn the position taken yesterday by the German [[Chancellor]], who interfered in Italian internal affairs, when he threatened that Europe would intervene if any [[neo-]]fascists became members of the [[government]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
8661	Mr [[President]], the previous [[speaker]] made it easy for [[me]] because he spoke in detail about [[Akin Birdal]] who was the leader of the human rights organisation in Turkey and who is mainly known for calling for a peaceful solution to the Kurdish question.	Male,Male,Amb,Amb
8662	Last time [[we]] talked about Serbia, [[I]] urged [[MEPs]] to exercise some patience with Mr [[Kostunica]] because I had the impression that there had been progress almost every day, and I believe we can see evidence of this progress, up to and including yesterday when Mr Kostunica declared himself willing to assume responsibility, which I believe is crucial, for the Serbian crimes in Kosovo.

8680	Mr [[President]], [[I]] too would like to begin by congratulating the [[rapporteur]] on his work of synthesis, which has been demonstrated by the compromise amendments supported by all of the political [[groups]].	Male,Amb,Male,Amb
8681	[[I]] can assure the honourable [[Member]], who I know has an abiding and passionate commitment to tackling injustice, not just at home but abroad, that [[we]] are determined to support the efforts of the partnership as I described, not least through the efforts of the Department for International Development that she highlighted in her question, but also by encouraging other Member States to play their important role in what is a hugely important contribution by the European Union plus Norway to confronting a genuinely global challenge and a global problem.	Amb,Female,Amb
8682	. As the honourable [[Member]] will be aware, Article 289 of the EC Treaty provides that the seat of the institutions of the Community shall be determined by common accord of the [[governments]] of the Member States.	Amb,Amb

8684	Mr [[Michel]], you have the floor again.	Male

8686	One of the landmark [[Court]] of Justice judgments was because of a British [[patient]] who travelled to another country to have a hip replacement operation on the grounds that her own health service - sadly in my own country - could not provide that treatment within anything like an acceptable time.	Amb,Female
8687	(DE) Madam [[President]], the human rights dialogue between the EU and China has been taking place twice a year behind closed doors for the last eleven years, and yet it has done nothing to improve the human rights situation in China.	Female
8688	[[I]] had a brilliant mathematics [[teacher]] who taught me there were three kinds of [[people]]: those who can count, and those who cannot.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8689	[[rapporteur]]. - (NL) I think that the [[Commissioner]] summarised his concerns on a number of points very well.	Amb,Male
8690	Their plea for short-term aid has fallen on deaf ears, even though it lies within the power of the local [[minister]] to pay de minimis aid under state rules.	Amb
8691	Adding to that, there are various measures that [[we]] have introduced in order to regain sustainable fishing, and that means that the [[fisher]] cannot try to improve his performance by catching more, because if he catches more, he creates further pressures on [[fish]] stocks which would then be, in the long term, counterproductive.	Amb,Male,Amb
8692	[[author]]. - (NL) Mr [[President]], the violence in Somalia has everything to do with the fact that since 1991 there has no longer been a generally recognised [[government]] there.	Amb,Male,Amb
8693	However, just like private venture capital, sovereign wealth funds can cover up exactly who the [[entrepreneur]] is.	Amb
8694	in writing. - [[I]] generally welcome Mr [[Von Wogau's]] report on space security.	Amb,Male
8695	Therefore, if the [[Commissioner]] makes a commitment to promoting regional integration, if she makes a commitment to greater flexibility so as to take into account the different levels of development of our [[partners]], perhaps she can tell [[us]] why she does not accept the offer of 71 % liberalisation proposed by Central Africa?	Female,Amb,Amb
8696	[[I]] would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr [[Marinescu]], for all his excellent work.	Amb,Male
8697	[[I]] am concerned with EFSA, Madam [[Commissioner]], and whether it has the resource capacity to process dossiers under this regulation in a timely but thorough way.	Amb,Female
8698	Can these [[worker]]-related measures be subsidised at the same time as the [[enterprise]]?	Amb,Amb
8699	(EL) [[Madam President]], [[I]] thank the [[minister]] for his reply, which listed all the measures planned.	Female,Amb,Male
8700	The alternating order will begin with the oldest female [[Member]].'	Female
8701	If the Second World War was the impetus for the post-war political modernisation of Western Europe, having become the logical conclusion of the relatively short period of domination by the Nazi regime in Germany, then for the USSR and Russia, the need for reconstruction was dictated by the experience of 70 years of domination by the Communist regime, the culmination of which was [[Stalin's]] terrorist dictatorship.	Amb
8702	[[I]] was shocked and dismayed to learn that the [[chair]] of the Committee on Foreign Affairs decided, without informing either his [[members]] - of whom I am one - or the [[co-chairs]] of this delegation, not to visit Gaza with Parliament's [[delegation]] on the instructions of the Israeli [[Embassy]].	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
8703	It is a pity that social engineering does not take account of historical experiences in order to avoid a new defeat, the first [[victims]] of which will be [[women]].	Female,Female
8704	The [[rapporteur]] proposed to shift the focus of the proposal and to mandate pharmaceutical [[companies]] to provide certain information to the [[patients]] and thus, to put the 'patients' right to know' at the centre of the legislation.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8705	Penalties should be more severe when the offence is committed against [[persons]] vulnerable on grounds of age, gender, pregnancy, health conditions, or disability, and must pay due account of cases where the [[victim]] has been subjected to torture, the forced administration of drugs or medication, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical and sexual violence.	Amb,Amb
8706	The results were proclaimed by the Independent Electoral [[Commission]] and certified by the special [[representative]] of the UN [[Secretary-General]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
8707	Commissioner [[Kroes]] was present during the vote and she announced that the amended version of the law was consistent with European law and, in particular, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	Female
8708	Mr [[President]], the previous [[speaker]] mentioned that she is calling for some sort of [[commission]] to go to Sri Lanka to look at what is going on on the ground there.	Male,Female,Amb
8709	[[I]] thank the honourable [[Member]] for her kind words.	Amb,Female
8710	[[I]] refer in particular to the stress on the fact that the [[patient]] is not a criminal, that, in reality, the prison environment is often a place where the risk of drug dependence develops and that the programme must cover all types of drug, without distinction.	Amb,Amb
8711	The [[rapporteur]] has said this morning that, in some respects, her report takes sides.	Female
8712	That is very much in line with what Mr [[Bertens]] called for: that [[we]] need some degree of continuity and a measure of adherence to some general rules in order not to be accused of discriminatory treatment.	Male,Amb
8713	Mr [[President]], Mr [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], the forthcoming summit between the European Union and the United States is perhaps a decisive and definitive opportunity to test whether or not the European Union has its own voice, and whether or not it has [[institutions]] whose actions are governed by the will to defend Community political and economic interests.	Male,Male,Female,Male,Amb
8714	In the new [[society]] which is emerging, it is increasingly the [[person]] who possesses knowledge who is also going to have power.	Amb,Amb
8715	Madam [[President]], Madam [[Commissioner]], I have here a card which affords me admission, as a [[member]] of the delegation from Senegal, to the FAO buildings where the diplomatic conference is being held concerning the institution of the International Court of Justice.	Female,Female,Amb
8716	Mr [[Fabre-Aubrespy]] has a point of order.	Male
8717	[[Women]] can no longer be treated by male [[doctors]], which has led to women dying in regions where there are no female [[doctors]].	Female,Male,Female
8718	[[I]] totally agree with that, Mr [[President]].	Amb,Male
8719	Mr [[Virgin]] is stuck in the snow somewhere between here and Sweden.	Male
8720	No other solution can be envisaged and this has to be said otherwise how, in 30 years' time, will [[I]] be able to find the responsible [[owner]], who has meanwhile closed down his [[company]] or his establishment?	Amb,Male,Amb
8721	This means that, in practice, a [[woman]] can be given priority for promotion in the event of equal suitability, competence and professional performance, unless reasons specific to an individual [[candidate]] tilt the balance in his favour.	Female,Male
8722	Contrary to what Mr [[Hendrick]] and Mrs [[Boogerd-Quaak]] said, unemployment has not increased.	Male,Female
8723	I am happy to be the first speaker for my [[group]] to welcome the German [[Chancellor]] as President-in-Office of the European Council to the European Parliament; [[everyone]] will understand that as a Social Democrat I am particularly glad to do so, especially following the statement you have just made, Mr President-in-Office of the Council!

8771	The [[teacher]] can also use richer and more authentic texts sooner, for instance in telling stories: Teacher: "…and her [[stepmother]] scolded her without mercy—schimpfte sie erbarmungslos aus—she scolded her without mercy…" Mother tongue equivalents are always and immediately given in contexts, which is a far cry from isolated vocabulary equations.

8773	A [[butler]] is usually male, and in charge of male [[servants]], while a [[housekeeper]] is usually a woman, and in charge of female [[servants]].	Male,Male,Female,Female
8774	Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher than at any time in living memory, republicanism was still a [[minority]] viewpoint, and the [[Queen]] herself had high approval ratings.	Amb,Female
8775	And where a [[Dürrenmatt]] drama might lead, with ghastly inevitability, to a worst possible outcome, the dénouement in a [[Frisch]] play typically involved a return to the starting position: the destiny that awaited his [[protagonist]] might be to have no destiny.	Amb,Male,Amb
8776	[[She]] worked as an [[actor]] at the Ernst Deutsches Theater Hamburg, the Schauspielhaus Zürich, the Berliner Ensemble and the Stadttheater Freiburg.	Female,Female

8801	In a secret ballot on 5 December 2005, the States' [[assembly]] elected [[Walker]] to be the first Chief Minister in Jersey history by 38 votes to [[Syvret's]] 14.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8802	As of 2013, it also had two associate [[members]], Puerto Rico and Tokelau.	Amb
8803	As a [[politician]] she needs to remind her [[officials]] how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year, were a similar incident, just as devastating, to take place, if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice.	Female,Amb
8804	It is common to all the [[speakers]] in the Chamber and to [[others]] outside that it is an excellent report but, speaking for [[myself]], I would not have expected any less from my honourable [[friend]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
8805	[[I]] should like, firstly, to apologise to the honourable [[Member]] if she finds that the written answer was not full enough.	Amb,Female
8806	The [[rapporteur]], whom [[I]] would like to thank very warmly, depicts very varied trends in expenditure under the Structural Funds. The picture is one of some positive aspects compared with previous years, combined with continuing problems.	Amb,Amb
8807	Mr [[President]], [[we]] have been sleepwalking for decades.	Male,Amb
8808	This [[Minister]], is what [[we]] expect from France, inspired precisely by the great confidence which we have in your country and in the leadership ability that we know France can display at difficult times in Europe's progress.	Amb,Amb
8809	[[I]] thank the [[Minister]] for his reply.	Amb,Male
8810	But [[I]] am talking, say, about an American [[professor]] who accepts a chair at a German university, receives a residence permit for the Federal Republic of Germany and who, when he wishes to give a guest lecture at the Sorbonne in Paris has to apply for a visa, which he is possibly still waiting for because the French or German [[authorities]] are not making progress on it. This is because of the diverse and - for the lack of a strategic plan - very heterogeneous administrative provisions in the Member States.	Amb,Male,Amb
8811	[[I]] shall now give Mrs [[Randzio-Plath]] the floor as the Rules of Procedure state that [[we]] must hear another [[speaker]] against the [[speaker]] of the [[group]] who tabled the request, and then we shall take the vote.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
8812	Let [[me]] make it quite clear, Mr [[President]], that our fellow [[Member]], the President of the European Parliament - who is, after all, the object of your criticism here - has behaved quite correctly, as she has described in her letter to the [[President]] of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.	Amb,Male,Female,Amb
8813	[[She]] is a [[lawyer]] or barrister by profession and perhaps she should have declared an interest.	Female,Female
8814	Does the power, or the fear, of the aforementioned [[person]] extend so far that he already has the [[People' s]] Party in his clutches?	Male,Amb
8815	Finally, [[Commissioner]], [[I]] should like to draw your attention to an old demand of the European Parliament: [[we]] have always said that with a region such as Taiwan, with which we in Europe have very intensive economic relations, our relations are such as to warrant a representation, that is an information office, being set up there.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8816	The next item is the report (A5-0235/2001) by Mr [[Zimmerling]], on behalf of the Parliamentary [[delegation]] to the Conciliation [[Committee]], on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the resale right for the benefit of the [[author]] of an original work of art (C5-0220/2001 - 1996/0085(COD))	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
8817	The oppositions between [[white]] and [[black]] would cease to exist.	Amb,Amb
8818	[[We]] therefore share the overwhelming concern expressed by the original rapporteur, Mrs [[Riis-Jørgensen]], with regard to this proposal.	Amb,Female
8819	A special mention for Mrs [[Buitenweg]], with whom [[I]] had the pleasure of working during this procedure, since she was the rapporteur dealing with the other institutions, and also for the [[draftsmen]] of the opinions who contributed to the involvement of each of the [[committees]] in the procedure.	Female,Amb,Male,Amb
8820	Mr [[President]], at the heart of this debate is the theme of protecting the public interest in contracts awarded by public [[authorities]].	Male,Amb
8821	Instead, [[they]] referred to an EU agreement not to invite the [[President]] of Taiwan, because to do so would threaten relations with China.	Amb,Amb
8822	Mr [[President]], [[I]] could specifically mention each of the amendments that the [[Commission]] cannot accept, but if the honourable [[Member]] agrees, I will give her in writing the reasons why we cannot accept the list of amendments I have just read out.	Male,Amb,Amb,Female
8823	Only once my [[assistant]] had picked herself up and gone into the House did she receive any support or help from the security [[staff]].	Female,Amb
8824	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr [[Berenguer Fuster]], and the [[Committee]] on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the quality of the report.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Male,Amb
8825	Above all, [[we]] have to look at the unfairness of the decision that was taken in imposing a punishment on the female [[partner]] in the name of some kind of religious belief.	Amb,Female
8826	[[I]] am especially grateful to our chairman, Mrs [[Redondo]], to the [[secretariat]], which did excellent work, to the scientific service, and to the [[Commission]].	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
8827	Most of the 60 million [[people]] living beneath the poverty line in the EU are [[women]].	Female,Female
8828	In any event, Mr [[Ortuondo]], Mr [[Nogueira]], [[I]] would ask you to keep your points of order brief.	Male,Male,Amb
8829	Nor has the [[Council]] accepted the establishment of a [[task force]] within the [[Commission]] to coordinate the different areas, but Mrs [[de Palacio]] has given [[us]] a certain amount of reassurance on that point.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
8830	For that reason it is a very good thing that the excellent report drawn up by my colleague, Mrs [[Ferrer]], argues the case for partnership strongly and on every page.	Female
8831	Various [[speakers]] - Mr [[Hernández Mollar]], Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, in particular - have spoken wise words on this subject.	Male,Male
8832	[[We]] have the capacity to pay for all of these initiatives and [[I]] would repeat that where the structural funds are concerned, for which I have direct responsibility, or training under Mrs [[Diamantopoulou]] or rural development under Mr [[Fischler]], we will be able to show a great deal of flexibility and accept all proposals to redeploy or reprogramme funds, as Portugal has by the way already proposed doing to the tune of EUR 182 million.	Amb,Amb,Female,Male
8833	That is why you, Mr [[Prodi]], may not say that, as [[I]] would rather Mr [[Berlusconi]] did it’.	Male,Amb,Male
8834	She is a positive [[person]] who has fought many important political battles for young [[people]], [[women]] and, now, the [[handicapped]].	Female,Amb,Female,Amb
8835	In other words, achieving, as we [[Socialists]] believe, full employment, gender equality – [[I]] would like to welcome the fact that the Irish [[Government]] has been the first to appoint a female [[Ambassador]] to Coreper, thereby entering into the most sexist realm of the Union, I congratulate it – social cohesion and technological development.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
8836	Madame [[Berès]], happily, on this question and the multiplicity of legal dimensions which you bring to my attention, [[I]] am not an [[expert]] and so I sought advice from [[those]] with expertise. I am advised that the course of action I followed was appropriate.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
8837	[[I]] spoke to a leading [[employee]] of Postcomm who told me that there was no reason for Royal Mail to retain this VAT exemption as it was not needed to protect either Royal Mail or the [[users]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
8838	Now there is much that is good about the directive, for which [[I]] wish to thank Mrs [[Rothe]], but I shall address its biggest problem.	Amb,Female
8839	Parliament has lost a [[colleague]], an excellent Member of Parliament, a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, vice-chairman of the Delegation to the Parliamentary Committee on EU-Ukraine Cooperation and deputy in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.	Male
8840	[[We]] have to make it abundantly clear that we will not be content with progress that exists only on paper, but demand that [[women’s]] rights be put into practice.	Amb,Female
8841	Yet legal logging in itself affords no guarantee whatsoever of sustainable development of the developing countries concerned, of any improvement in the social situation of local [[people]] or protection of biodiversity and the environment.	Amb
8842	Mr [[Putin]] congratulated [[Lukashenko]] on his victory without as much as batting an eyelid.	Male,Male
8843	Regarding this, the [[Council]] stated on 17 October that it greatly valued the perseverance with which High Representative [[Javier Solana]] has since June encouraged Iran to respond to the demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency's governing [[board]] and the UN Security [[Council]] and continued talks on long-term arrangements.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
8844	The [[Chair]] of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is well aware of this, as just a few days ago [[I]] had the opportunity to discuss with her how [[we]] can put it into practice.	Female,Amb,Amb
8845	(SV) Mr [[President]], it is not clear to [[me]] whether the [[Minister]] believes that Turkey must acknowledge the genocide or whether this is something that is to be left up to Turkey and Armenia to settle.	Male,Amb,Amb
8846	Like Mr [[Lehne]], [[I]] feel that the time has come to enact laws to set up the European Private Company as a reliable legal form for small and medium-sized undertakings (SMEs) engaged in cross-border business.	Male,Amb
8847	Please be careful that Mr [[Brown]] signs in pen rather than in pencil!	Male
8848	[[I]] ask myself today, when the spirit of Europe moves upon the face of the waters and above this Parliament, why Mr [[Schulz]] has lost his revolutionary sensitivity.	Amb,Male
8849	on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr [[President]], [[Minister]], [[Commissioner]], this afternoon [[I]] am speaking on behalf of Mrs [[Gutiérrez-Cortines]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
8850	Sadly, the [[rapporteur]] herself seems not to believe that.	Female
8851	One in four [[people]] suffer from mental health problems at least once in their life.	Amb
8852	[[I]] wish to thank you for your report, Mrs [[Kósáné Kovács]]. I can tell you that my colleague, Commissioner [[Špidla]], and I are very aware of these problems.	Amb,Female,Amb
8853	It is, by the way, characteristic that while the European [[Right]] does not relativise [[Nazi]] crimes today, the European [[Left]] does relativise [[Communist]] crimes.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
8854	(MT) Madam [[President]], Mr [[Barroso]], financial and economic challenges have been extensively discussed.	Female,Male
8855	[[I]] support this measure and I am fully confident that this [[committee]] will conduct an appropriate analysis of the scope of the financial crisis which has affected every Member State, and that it will put forward [[expert]] recommendations contributing to the European Union's economic recovery.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8856	This was our third Question Hour with the [[President]] of the European Commission.	Amb
8857	[[We]] are a few days away from the opening of the Vancouver Olympic Games, and I have the honour of being the joint [[chair]] of an Olympic Games organising [[committee]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
8858	It is, no doubt, Europe's most important human rights instrument and the importance of the Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights - maybe even for Mr [[Fox]] - is clear from the fact that it handles an average of 30 000 complaints a year.	Male
8859	[[I]] tried to distribute it evenly according to the strength of the political [[groups]] so, if [[you]] noticed, there were three [[speakers]] from the PPE Group, two [[speakers]] from the PSE Group, one [[speaker]] from the ALDE Group, one from the EFD Group and one from the non-attached [[Members]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
8860	Because, yesterday evening, on all the French television channels, a future presidential [[candidate]] made a spectacle of himself by tearing up a EUR 10 note that he had photocopied and enlarged, and showing that, by tearing up that note, he was tearing up the cause of all our ills.	Male
8861	Did [[you]] see that the [[people]] who came with knives were Mr [[Mubarak's]] policemen?	Amb,Male,Male
8862	Mr [[President]], it is not just for his last comment that [[I]] want to thank the [[rapporteur]] but also for the work he has done and the speed with which he has done it.	Male,Amb,Male
8863	the statements by the Council and [[Commission]] on the preparation for the European Council meeting in Florence on 21 and 22 June; -the oral questions by Mr [[Morán López]], on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, to the Council (B40444/96-0-0115/96) and to the Commission (B4-0445/96-0-0116/96) on the progress of the IGC.[[I]] have just discovered that the Italian [[Minister]] for Foreign Affairs is still on his way here.	Amb,Male,Amb,Male
8864	Again, as regards [[child]] abduction, all of [[us]] who have constituencies - as in the UK - are likely to have to face the anguish of one or other [[parent]] trying to retrieve their child from another country, sometimes against near impossible odds.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8865	Development and the environment - as our [[colleague]] points out in his report - cannot be opposing concepts but must be complementary.	Male
8866	Mr [[Dupuis]], [[I]] think it would be a very bad thing, this week, prior to the Council of [[Ministers']] decision on the 24th, to discuss whether this concerns [[doves]], [[partridges]], [[rabbits]] or [[hares]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
8867	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] did not quite understand the reference made by our [[colleague]] from the Green Group to Italy and the lack of transparency in the handling of Italian monetary policy; she can explain it to me later.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Female
8868	[[Jacques Santer]] has promised to clean up his Commission, and that is why [[I]] rejected the motion of censure.	Male,Amb
8869	[[I]] should first like to thank the [[Commissioner]] most sincerely for her lengthy reply to my question. Her detailed account of the major restructuring which has taken place at Ispra and, in particular, of the new activities undertaken by the Institute for Health will also be of great interest to the general [[public]].	Amb,Female,Amb
8870	Among the possibilities opened up by the draft directive is the purchase of medicinal products without [[expert]] advice, which, as Mrs [[Heinisch]] said, creates a potential health risk that must not be underestimated.	Amb,Female

8930	[[Roberts]] called his [[wife]] from the schoolhouse on his cell phone and told her that he had molested two young female [[relatives]] (between the ages of 3 and 5) 20 years previously (when he was 12) and had been daydreaming about molesting again.	Male,Female,Female
8931	She is a [[student]] at the Masaryk University in Brno.	Female
8932	In 1847, at Limeburners' Point near Geelong, Victoria, [[Charles La Trobe]], a keen amateur geologist, was examining the shells from a lime kiln when a [[worker]] showed him a set of five keys that he claimed to have found, subsequently named the Geelong Keys.	Male,Male
8933	In 2015 and 2016 [[she]] was named a Thomson-Reuters/Clarivate Analytics 'highly cited' [[researcher]].	Female,Female
8934	On the ground floor there were the rooms reserved for the [[servants]].	Amb
8935	[[She]] began as an Atari [[employee]], designing and programing 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe (1979) for the Atari 2600.	Female,Female
8936	[[Arthur]] hires his [[firm]] to sell several properties to a [[Count Dracula]] in Transylvania.	Male,Amb,Male
8937	Another [[writer]] relied on [[Jobus Fincelius]] when he gives the year of the miraculous birth as 1313 and stated [[Margaret]] was Irish.	Male,Male,Amb
8938	[[She]] has Italian and US citizenship.	Female
8939	They are styled [[His]] or Her [[Majesty]].	Male,Amb

8946	The full declaration certainly costs money, and the [[farmer]] ultimately has to foot the bill.	Amb
8947	[[I]] would like to inform [[you]] that the [[teacher]] in question invented the whole story and has confessed that he was not the victim of an attack at all but that his wounds were self-inflicted.	Amb,Amb,Male
8948	Because if [[you]] believe that domestic work should be recognised as an occupation in its own right, and Mrs [[Smet]] says that, and [[I]] echo her sentiments, then what you meet with in the first instance is disbelief and a lack of understanding.	Amb,Female,Amb
8949	Moreover, the [[artist]] is assigned a right of information so that he can make his claims to royalties known to a professional art [[dealer]] during a period of up to three years, which is reasonable since the dealer has to keep the accounts of his purchases and sales.	Male,Amb
8950	It is, therefore, surprising that the [[Commission]] has again appointed a [[man]] as Director-General for aid and development despite the fact that there was a very well qualified female [[candidate]].	Amb,Male,Female
8951	The crucial question throughout has been whether or not to support Mrs [[Niebler's]] amendment - my fellow Member, Mr [[van Velzen]], is engaged in conversation just now, but he addressed this point and pleaded in favour of it.	Female,Male
8952	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], on behalf of my [[group I]] would like to thank my [[colleague]] for her very creditable work.	Male,Amb,Amb,Female
8953	I am speaking here as a [[Member]] of Parliament and not as the [[chair]], and I have not signed anywhere as chair.	Amb,Amb
8954	The Socialist [[Group]] will therefore vote in favour of the report and endorse two amendments tabled by Mrs [[Junker]]. Regarding these amendments, [[I]] would like to highlight the need for Community legislation to ensure that events or shows of great interest to the [[citizens]] should be protected from digitalisation so that they can be made available to all social classes free of charge.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
8955	[[We]] seem to have ended up with a rather woolly form of words here that is not helpful for any [[judge]] or other [[person]] that has to make a decision on this.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8956	[[They]] say that it would force many ports to restructure, yet would do nothing to improve efficiency in a cargo handling market characterised by competition between ports, not within ports.	Amb
8957	We need to give [[them]] the means to travel and to receive education and healthcare because ultimately we, the [[women]] of the same world as them, are a little anxious.	Female,Female
8958	Therefore, [[I]] can only hope that, in future, the European Union will send a single [[representative]] to the United Nations, and I hope that this representative will be the young Mrs [[Kauppi]], who has shown both the [[Pensioners]]' Party and all the [[parties]] represented in this Parliamentary House in Strasbourg that she cares deeply about elderly [[people]].	Amb,Female,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
8959	[[I]] therefore thank the [[rapporteur]] for his excellent work.	Amb,Male
8960	[[I]] note the point [[you]] make, but I should like to point out that a week ago in Brussels [[we]] had a meeting of the [[speakers]] of the national parliaments: the [[speaker]] from Estonia is a woman and the Estonian Foreign [[Minister]] is also a woman, so the gender balance may be better than it appears on the list of [[observers]] submitted.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Female,Female,Amb
8961	[[We]] have national [[champions]] in certain sectors – not just energy, but also telecommunications – which are often also national champions under public ownership, in which the State finds itself playing the dual role of controller and direct acting manager of [[companies]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
8962	When, however, [[I]] read about all these rights couched in long words, I am led to think about a Danish [[politician]] who, back home in our windswept country, got elected on a programme designed to give a boost to cycle paths.	Amb,Amb
8963	, Madam [[Chairman]], Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]].	Female,Male,Female,Male
8964	[[I]] was talking recently with a Danish [[expert]] who works for a private [[firm]] and for the EU in the former Yugoslavia, and he reported that the aid provided by the World Bank, the EBRD and the EIB is monitored quite differently.	Amb,Male,Amb
8965	– [[I]] am sorry for my [[colleague]], however he is going to hear more about the socialist dimension, because that is what [[we]] want to see, that the [[people]] become the centre of attention.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
8966	[[Madam President]], [[I]] should like to thank the [[President]] of the Commission and the [[President-in-Office]] of the Council, as well as our [[rapporteurs]], for the mood they have set with regard to this debate today.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
8967	Madam [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would like to begin by expressing the [[Commission]]’[[s]] thanks to the European Parliament, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and in particular to Mrs [[Roth-Behrendt]], the rapporteur, and Mr [[Schnellhardt]] as second rapporteur for their hard work on this dossier.	Female,Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Male
8968	Mr [[President]], the [[Committee]] on Budgets was pleased to address the financial aspects of these issues.	Male,Amb
8969	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to thank the [[rapporteur]] and congratulate him on behalf of my [[group]] on his magnificent report, which could not have been produced if he had not been generous enough to accept many amendments and suggestions from other [[Members]] representing different fishing regions with very different views of small-scale fishing.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
8970	[[I]] should like to conclude with a vote of thanks to Mrs [[Krehl]].	Amb,Female
8971	(IT) Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] voted in favour of Mrs [[Gebhardt's]] report, mainly because I come from a border area, where these difficulties are experienced on a daily basis.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Female
8972	'The US fights, the UN feeds and the EU funds'. Those are the words of a French international affairs [[student]].	Amb
8973	[[I]] should also very much like to congratulate Mr [[Bonde]], Mrs [[Frassoni]] and Mr [[Wurtz]] and to tell them how much I appreciated the high standard of their campaigns.	Amb,Male,Female,Male
8974	The papers go on to state that 'German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] pledged to fight "with full vigour” the plans to introduce across-the-board limits on CO2 emissions from cars ...'.	Amb
8975	(DE) [[President-in-Office]], [[Mr President]], my sincere congratulations on your excellent work, Madam [[Chancellor]].	Amb,Male,Female
8976	The questionnaire and recommendations developed by the [[Secretary-General]] of the Council of Europe under Article 52 of the European Convention on Human Rights also allowed, both in Portugal and [[I]] believe in other Member States, an unprecedented assessment of the national legal frameworks, guarantees and control mechanisms as a whole, including the analysis of procedures for sorting, verifying and inspecting requests for authorisation for aircraft overflights and landings on national territory.	Amb,Amb
8977	Through your various contacts with [[colleagues]] in other parliaments around the world, with [[representatives]] of industry and with civil society, [[we]] are counting on the support of the European Parliament in promoting the EU's ambitious aims regarding the issue of climate change.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8978	If the [[owner]] of a registered weapon wishes to go hunting in most other EU countries, he simply produces his Europass at his point of entry, but if he wants to enter the United Kingdom he must supply his original Europass in advance, and then wait six to eight weeks for it to be processed by the local [[police]].	Male,Amb
8979	[[author]]. - (ES) Mr [[President]], I think East Timor is an example of where self-determination processes can be carried out, and carried out well.	Amb,Male
8980	[[Member]] of the Commission. - Mr [[President]], honourable [[Members]], Ms [[de Brún]], let me start by thanking you very much for the excellent work on the evaluation of the PEACE programme and also strategies for the future.	Amb,Male,Amb,Female

8982	(PT) Madam [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] congratulate the [[rapporteur]] on the work that has been done in this report and on her speech just now.	Female,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Female
8983	Only 5% of world [[leaders]] are women.	Female
8984	This national [[minister]] simply needs to come to an agreement with his regional [[ministers]], await their regional policy statements and management declarations and then present them all to this [[House]] and to the [[public]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
8985	The summit of the 43 [[Heads]] of State or Government within the Union for the Mediterranean will take place on 7 June in Barcelona and, as the European Parliament, [[we]] must hope that this meeting proves a success for the launch of the UfM institutions and the implementation of the projects.	Amb,Amb
8986	Will the euro area continue freely to admit new [[member]] countries?	Amb
8987	We have taken note of your comments but as [[Members]] of the European Parliament, we would also like to be able to monitor these commitments. That means having information about the promises made and the timetable provided by the French [[authorities]].	Amb,Amb
8988	The Portuguese [[Minister]] for Health is therefore quite wrong when she says that this option is for better educated [[people]] and [[those]] with greater financial resources: that is what happens now, without the directive.	Female,Amb,Amb
8989	The [[citizen]] wants security in his life, but he also wants more freedom, and at present [[we]] are providing that only in a limited way and to a limited extent.	Male,Amb
8990	Of course, [[I]] think that the [[Commission]] should be punished because, as it is the body chosen by [[governments]], it is also a sort of joint government commission. And, of course, it is not an elected body.	Amb,Amb,Amb
8991	[[I]] hope a solution can be found in the coming weeks.	Amb
8992	The second point raised by Mrs [[Green]] concerns the deadline for tabling amendments on the Amsterdam European Council.	Female
8993	[[I]] have great sympathy with Mr [[Virgin]] but could the [[Commission]] say whether there is a simple mechanism for those countries which have so far indicated that they do not want to import these wastes, or have not given an answer, simply to change their minds if the full facts are brought to their attention?	Amb,Male,Amb
8994	[[I]] would say simply this. Mrs [[McKenna]], I understand your commitment as regards the respect of [[human]] rights in this part of the world.	Amb,Female,Amb
8995	The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A4-0380/97) by Mr [[Cassidy]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 93/6/EEC on the capital adequacy of investment [[firms]] and credit [[institutions]] (COM(97)0071 - C4-0304/97-97/0124(COD))	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
8996	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to come back to the point made by Mr [[Schäfer]], Mrs [[Theato]] and Mr [[Caccavale]].	Male,Amb,Male,Female,Male
8997	Mr [[Bangemann]] told [[me]] here a year ago that there was a working [[group]] dealing with this issue.	Male,Amb,Amb
8998	[[I]] would like to point out that my question would have been the fourth question if it could have been answered by Mr [[Kinnock]].	Amb,Male
8999	With regard to EC regulations, [[we]] already have a directive which establishes a list of authorized additives for use in [[animal]] feed and a regulation which defines a Community procedure establishing the maximum residue limits for veterinary drugs in foods of animal origin.	Amb,Amb

9101	Mrs [[Lambert]] and Mr [[Messner]], on behalf of the [[Verts]]/ALE Group, on India (B5-0299/2002);	Female,Male,Amb
9102	I am such a staunch [[supporter]] of self-regulation because in my view, a number of processes in the European Commission are too slow.	Amb
9103	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] wish to congratulate Mrs [[Van Lancker]] on her report.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Female
9104	The first report - Mrs [[Angelilli's]], which has to do with the compensation of [[victims]] of crime - addresses a mechanism that would help to alleviate to some extent the effects of these unwelcome emergencies, which arise from freedom of movement itself.	Female,Amb
9105	Mr [[President]], let [[me]] begin where the previous [[speaker]] left off.	Male,Amb,Amb
9106	Let [[us]] therefore review everything that Europe has accepted, with little or no reaction, from [[Ariel Sharon]] in Palestine over the past two years.	Amb,Amb
9107	This is hard to understand, since, after all, [[Galileo]] is important to maritime safety.	Amb
9108	That is right: there are still 113 million [[children]] who do not attend school and most of them are [[girls]], as Mr [[van den Berg]] has already said.	Female,Female,Male
9109	Over the last few days, a young Israeli [[doctor]] came to visit [[me]]. She spent two years in the [[military]] and now she is providing medical care in a mobile clinic in the Palestinian territories.	Female,Amb,Amb
9110	The knowledge of languages does not only help the [[student]] with a university degree to secure a better competitive position within the labour market, it also contributes to his cultural baggage, and, lest [[we]] forget, to mutual understanding.	Male,Amb
9111	This sort of selection procedure does nothing whatever to ensure that the next [[Commission]] will include the best male [[Commissioners]] and enough outstanding female [[ones]].	Amb,Male,Female
9112	According to the [[Committee]] on Legal Affairs and the [[rapporteur]] of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the absence of a reference to Article 300(3) of the EC Treaty, stipulating that [[Parliament]] should be consulted, could only be the result of an oversight, which should be rectified.	Amb,Amb,Amb
9113	[[I]] would like to thank Mr [[Barnier]] for mentioning my name, and I wish him every success at the helm of the French Foreign Ministry.	Amb,Male
9114	– Mr [[President]], [[I]] wish I could also say Commissioner but Mr [[Verheugen]] has left [[us]] very early and I am sorry about that, nearly all the political [[parties]] in Greece and the most important parties in Cyprus have come out in favour of the [[Annan]] plan.	Male,Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
9115	This Euro-apathy will become rejection of Europe if [[we]] go over the [[public’s]] heads in this way.	Amb,Amb
9116	Whilst [[one]] must welcome the fact that the Eurogroup has a permanent chairman in the shape of Mr [[Junker]], it nonetheless remains the case that a chairman simply presides over meetings and does not make decisions.	Amb,Male
9117	For this reason, and also speaking for my [[group]], [[I]] am very grateful to the [[Commissioner]] for her particular concern for this issue, which she has again underlined in her brief statement today.	Amb,Amb,Female
9118	. – It has been stressed by various [[speakers]] in this debate and also in various reports and pronouncements by the [[Commission]] and the [[Council]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
9119	The [[Minister]] and his services will be bound by Commission procedures and the principles of collegiality, under the guidance of the Commission’s [[President]].	Male,Amb
9120	Mr [[Martin Schulz]], [[I]] am perfectly aware [[who]] is changing the order.	Male,Amb,Amb
9121	Mrs [[Krehl]] raised the point of the financial perspective.	Female
9122	After all, at the last European election, a [[Member]] was elected who seems to have disappeared now, but who, at the time of the election, said his ambition was to come here to disrupt [[Parliament]], to prevent it from working.	Male,Amb
9123	If that was so, the dramatic reduction in the number of fishing vessels that are now fishing for [[cod]] in the North Sea – numbers have collapsed by 60% through decommissioning in the last five years – would have led to a remarkable recovery in cod stocks, but that has not been the case.	Amb
9124	Now, Mrs [[Hall]], as regards local [[NGOs]] who feel that they have not been treated properly by the [[Commission]], if you have specific NGOs with specific projects in mind, then [[I]] would like to hear about them.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
9125	However, [[they]] are afraid that a [[nurse]] providing her services as a small business would generate too much competition and are disguising ...	Amb,Female
9126	[[We]] have chosen to abstain in the vote on the report for the simple reason that the [[rapporteur]] seems to have failed in her report to focus attention on the [[child's]] best interests.	Amb,Female,Amb
9127	It proposes a strict division of tasks between the [[Commission]], the supervisory [[authority]] and the European Space Agency, with the Commission being assigned the role of [[owner]] and the European Space Agency the role of [[manager]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
9128	The [[Minister]] said he had not received satisfactory answers from the Chinese [[authorities]] so far.	Male,Amb
9129	on behalf of the [[Verts]]/ALE Group. - Mr [[President]], [[we]] too welcome the [[Lynne]] report and fully support the commitment to a comprehensive directive and see this as part of the cultural shift that Mrs [[Bauer]] referred to.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Female
9130	[[I]] have now seen again that in politics there is a real risk of staking everything on a cure-all and then railroading it through with all vigour while promising the [[people]] that this will solve all their problems.	Amb,Amb
9131	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], on behalf of my [[group I]] should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr [[Kirkhope]], most sincerely.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Male
9132	(DE) Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], first of all, [[I]] would like to thank Mr [[El Khadraoui]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Male
9133	the report by Mrs [[Estrela]], on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant [[workers]] and [[workers]] who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding - C6-0340/2008 -.	Female,Female,Female
9134	All too often, there is not only confusion between [[victim]] and [[perpetrator]], but there are [[governments]] - and sadly the Italian Government has not paid much attention to this matter - which put victims of the same type of crime on a different footing from each other.	Amb,Amb,Amb
9135	However, this evaluation and these records alone cannot bring greater prosperity to [[citizens]] purely and simply because, apparently, they will give [[consumers]] greater self-confidence and security.	Amb,Amb
9136	[[I]] will give one further example: a [[student]] preparing his PhD thesis in Lisbon on the history of the Americas is unable to consult the files and documents housed in the General Archive of the Indies in Seville, which is one hour away by plane.	Amb,Male
9137	The rulings supporting the ban on a female [[teacher]] wearing the veil in the classroom and opposing crucifixes in schools testify to this.	Female
9138	The text which is being debated today proposes numerous support mechanisms for female [[workers]], providing the basis for legal certainty which will give women freedom of choice and, as a consequence, a real work-life balance.	Female
9139	Why, in this context, is the position of the Chinese [[ambassador]] on this matter more relevant than our desire to talk about what is happening in Tibet?	Amb
9140	(HU) Mr [[President]], as a Hungarian and a female politician, [[I]] am proud that it was a Hungarian female Member, Mrs [[Kinga Gál]], who created with considerable effort this very significant work on a better assertion of human rights, and brought it before the European Union.	Male,Female,Female
9141	(DE) Madam [[President]], [[I]] was in Croatia a few days ago and never has so much been spoken about Serbia there as in recent days, and specifically in a very positive sense because of exactly what Mr [[Brok]] said - the brave moves that Mr [[Tadić]] has made together with President [[Josipović]] - and I am also aware that Deputy Prime Minister [[Đelić]] is heavily involved in this regard - are significant steps towards Europe.	Female,Amb,Male,Male,Amb,Amb
9142	I myself am a [[person]] with a disability, and I am perhaps more sensitive than the average [[person]] to discrimination or double standards.	Amb,Amb
9143	[[Kinga Göncz]] is not from my party but [[I]] am appalled by the way that Ms [[Morvai]] used a debate about the last dictatorship in Europe - Belarus under Mr [[Lukashenko]] - to discredit an honourable [[Member]] of this Parliament by calling her a Hungarian Lukashenko.	Female,Amb,Female,Male,Female
9144	For example, [[I]] met a school [[secretary]] who paid over EUR 2 000 because the school could not afford to pay it as she felt responsible because she had signed the form.	Amb,Female
9145	Seen as a whole, this is an important contribution towards replacing the status of [[women employees]] with that of female working [[citizens]], and in quantitative terms it is a significant contribution.	Female,Female
9146	[[I]] had another question for the [[Commissioner]], which I hope she will answer.	Amb,Female
9147	Madam [[President]], [[I]] should like to point out that Mr [[Malerba]], who was to present a report this morning, was involved in an accident last week. I am glad to say the accident was not serious, but Mr Malerba has had to be admitted to hospital.	Female,Amb,Male
9148	[[I]] should like to end, Mr [[President]], by congratulating the [[rapporteur]] and underlining the fact that this report represents a major step forward in the promotion of [[workers']] rights - promoting the mobility of EU workers - and in the completion of the internal market.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
9149	The Council of [[Ministers]] and the [[Commission]] therefore consider the Israeli [[government's]] decision as particularly negative and unjustified at a time when the peace process was beginning to pick up again on account of a series of positive steps, such as the agreement regarding the Hebron protocol, the release of Palestinian female [[prisoners]] and an increase in the number of Palestinian [[workers]] with permits to enter Israel.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
9150	Confident in finding, Mr [[President]], the full support of the European Parliament for the implementation of these recommendations by the Member States, the [[Commission]], as it has endeavoured to do for the past two and a half years, will continue to associate your [[Chamber]] as closely as possible with its work, as it does unceasingly, for the introduction of the Euro within the framework of the conditions and timetable anticipated by the Treaty.	Male,Amb,Amb
9151	[[I]] welcome the [[guests you]] mention. However, as you know, the Rules of this House are that the [[Chair]] only welcomes [[visitors]] who have been officially invited.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
9152	Although it would have been better if the British minister, Mr [[Hogg]], had appeared in front of the [[Committee]] of Inquiry, [[I]] think it is an over-reaction to want to compel the [[members]] of the governments of Member States to appear at a Committee of Inquiry of the European Parliament.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
9153	[[I]] think [[we]] should congratulate the [[Committee]] and especially, [[Commissioner]], you should convey to your colleague, Mr [[Flynn]], our congratulations for the work he has done and for the pressure he has had to bear from the political as well as other viewpoints.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Male
9154	Secondly, the operational independence of UCLAF will be strengthened. This will be achieved by providing the [[head]] of UCLAF with a status similar to that of the independent financial [[controller]].	Amb,Amb
9155	Madam [[President]], my [[group]] would wish to condemn these tests but we would recognise in so doing that this was a political explosion in response to a [[party]] political programme: and to that extent [[I]] agree with Mr [[Smith]] that it is actually very similar to the last French tests.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Male
9156	It is as if only the [[mayor]] were to have the right to submit proposals in the municipalities - an absurd thought!	Amb
9157	So it is encouraging that the Cohesion Fund has at last reached the ultra-peripheral regions, for example, as a result of this [[House's]] repeated efforts to call attention to their needs.	Amb
9158	[[I]] would refer [[her]] to the comments of her colleague, the Austrian Foreign [[Minister]], earlier on today in Parliament, when he said that job creation would be the top priority of the presidency and that under the Amsterdam Treaty the EU now had the necessary instruments available via national employment plans in specific and binding areas.	Amb,Female,Male
9159	As far as [[Socrates]] is concerned, it involves strengthening the European dimension of education at all levels, promoting cooperation in the field of education, removing obstacles to such cooperation and fostering innovation in this area.	Amb
9160	[[I]] think [[we]] must try and explain to our Israeli [[friends]], with all the patience of a [[saint]], that it is not normal for us to simply donate money and do nothing else. We have been reminded of this on several occasions, although there now appears to be more discretion.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
9161	If he does not, then he is a [[candidate]] for the sack.	Male
9162	The decision as to how these posts are to be filled will lie with the future [[director]] of OLAF.	Amb

9186	The song, written by [[Diane Warren]], is about a [[woman]] who is willing to set her [[lover]] free because she is confident that one day his love will lead him back to her: "Sometimes it takes some time out on your own now / to find your way back home".	Female,Female,Male
9187	At the press conference in December 2012 launching her campaign Не мовчи (Don't keep silent) the [[singer]] was led in handcuffs by two hooded military [[guards]].	Female,Amb
9188	Any other [[artist]] can't use this name.	Amb
9189	Characteristic for this period are the term "Comic Theatre" for her works and her declining to be catalogued as Kabarett [[artist]].	Female

9193	For the [[protagonist]], the object of her dedication remains her [[daughter]], not God.	Female,Female
9194	[[Fanny Burney]] is quoted in [[Boswell's]] Life of Samuel Johnson as saying in 1780 she thought [[Carter]] "a really noble-looking woman; I never saw age so graceful in the female sex yet; her whole face seems to beam with goodness, piety, and philanthropy."	Female,Amb,Female
9195	Reforms included the introduction of scientific sections, the appointment of a congress [[president]], the restructuring of the annual congress with plenary sessions, symposiums, hot-topic sessions and workshops and participation in anti-smoking PR campaigns of the Deutsche Lungenstiftung ("German Lung Foundation"), e.g. Be Smart Don’t Start.

9204	The [[Director]] Task Force's total casualties between 15 December 1943 and the end of major fighting in the area were 118 dead, 352 wounded, and four missing.	Amb
9205	In 1547, when Electoral Saxon [[troops]] plundered and razed the weakly defended castle during the Schmalkaldic War, [[Henry's]] son, [[Wolf of Ende]], sold the castle and Barony of Rochsburg for 60,000 guilders to the three lords, [[George]], [[Hugo]] and [[Wolf II of Schönburg]], who were thus able to further expand their considerable estates in the upper valley of the Zwickau Mulde.

9211	[[Teacher]] at the Institut d'études politiques d'Aix-en-Provence, [[he]] was the founder and was director until 2006 of the Observatoire du religieux.	Male,Male
9212	Even before [[she]] met [[Georg Herwegh]] she was enthusiastic about another revolution: I read about French revolutionary history and was seized by a volcanic passion, at once burning, at once half frozen. - But how might it be if the time came when every [[man]] thought like a [[king]], when everyone was taught such a level of empowerment that [[people]] saw one another only as brothers, where only merit mattered, where divine spirit was revealed in every human heart, to the point where kings were no longer needed?	Female,Amb,Male,Male,Male
9213	The ruins of the church are still visible, and the legend states that the [[kings]] and [[princes]] who lived in that palace established the church.	Male,Male
9214	At this time there was a message for [[spectators]] on the huge screen behind the [[artist]].	Amb,Amb
9215	"[[I]] finally understood that armed struggle was the only solution, that a rifle cannot be met with a flower, that [[we]] were in the streets, but if that force didn't get organized we wouldn't achieve much", she said.	Female,Amb
9216	It seems to have come from the heart of the [[singer]].	Amb
9217	Even in his current phase, the [[artist]] shows himself adventurous and works, e.g., with formats on wood.	Male

9223	High-stage communism also completely abolishes the division of labor: In communist society, where [[nobody]] has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for [[me]] to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear [[cattle]] in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.

9229	Difficulties to do so depend on the [[teacher]].	Amb
9230	His epithet the [[Founder]] is due to two things: first, he founded the University of Vienna in 1365, and second, he began the construction of the gothic nave in the Stephansdom.	Male

9235	Under the formula of the London Declaration, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] is the Head of the Commonwealth, a title that is by law a part of Elizabeth's royal titles in each of the Commonwealth realms, the 16 [[members]] of the Commonwealth that recognise the Queen as their monarch.	Female,Amb

9238	Mr [[President]], quite often a parliamentary [[colleague]] is given a report and you envy him or her.	Male,Amb
9239	The question raised therefore provides the [[Presidency-in-Office]] with an opportunity to clarify several points.	Amb
9240	(Having invited Mrs [[Parly]], President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs [[Schreyer]], member of the Commission, Mr [[Wynn]], Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and the rapporteurs, Mrs [[Haug]], Mr [[Ferber]] and Mr [[Colom i Naval]] to join her, the [[President]] signed the budget.)	Female,Female,Male,Female,Male,Male,Female
9241	The [[Commission]], however, is not disposed, certainly at this juncture, to contemplate the possibility of sanctions of various kinds, including the ones suggested by the honourable [[Member]], simply because the Commission is making its contribution and its commitment on behalf of the Union in full knowledge of the dire needs of [[people]] and [[organisations]] in that area.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
9242	For example, during his meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Mr [[Sharon]], the Dutch [[minister]] encountered clear criticism of the Middle East policy of the EU.	Male,Male
9243	It is odd, to say the least, that a President such as Mr [[Chen]], who has, after all, been democratically elected, cannot enter the European Union, even in a private capacity.	Male
9244	Mrs [[Weiler]], [[I]] would like to express my congratulations to you on this work, but also wish to point out three major problems that I find in the real world, which is not quite as rosy as it is depicted in some of the [[Commission's]] assessments or, indeed, in this report.	Female,Amb,Amb
9245	Never mind that there is no scrap of evidence that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction, even nuclear weapons, never mind that Mr [[Blair]] has again postponed the publication of his own private dossier on the matter.	Male
9246	In a constantly changing media environment, the presence of public service television channels and private television channels, as well as restrictions on mergers and acquisitions between commercial [[players]], are essential in order to maintain audiovisual pluralism and cultural diversity.	Amb
9247	[[I]] wanted to stress that I was paying great attention in an opposite room watching the screen, which indicated the order of [[speakers]] and that Question No 51, the one previous to mine, did not show up on the screen.	Amb,Amb
9248	The other reason is the [[governments']], and also the [[Commission's]], fear of using [[Community]] resources for subsidies which are not directed towards [[farmers]] or large public works.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
9249	If Mr [[Antonione]] wishes to answer – and [[I]] say this to him explicitly – at the request of the honourable [[Member]], then he may do so.	Male,Amb,Amb
9250	As regards the Singapore issues in particular, Commissioner [[Lamy]] is reporting greater flexibility on the part of the [[Commission]], the kind of flexibility that emerged right at the end of the Cancún process, too late in the day in my opinion.	Amb,Amb
9251	[[People]] who plant antipersonnel mines, kill [[children]], take pleasure in their own cruelty and act treacherously can only be described as terrorists.	Amb,Amb
9252	Instead, as is largely clear from the document presented by the rapporteur, Mrs [[Junker]], the report focuses almost exclusively on issues concerning reproduction and sexual education, issues that are indeed very important but that do not necessarily have to be separated from a wider context and dealt with in a sterile manner, especially if these statements are not fully in line with the Cairo conclusions.	Female
9253	– Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], let [[me]] start by expressing my special thanks to our rapporteur, Mr [[Manders]], who, as [[we]] have seen him do so often in the past, has done an outstanding job of defending the environmental liability directive in the conciliation procedure, and so, this evening, let me thank him for that and also for the good personal cooperation.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Male,Amb
9254	It is absurd for the European Parliament to set itself up as a [[judge]] on a sensitive issue that can affect the peace process in Northern Ireland.	Amb
9255	[[I]] wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, my Swedish fellow Member Mrs [[Svensson]], for having included many important issues worth highlighting in this context.	Amb,Female

9259	Today, with this directive, the proclamations of the 'bad [[teacher]]' become proclamations 'without frontiers'.	Amb
9260	As a university [[lecturer]], I think that the report's appeal to Member States to work together with higher education and vocational institutions to create a more flexible framework for studying, which takes advantage of new technology in the field of education, deserves our full support.	Amb
9261	in writing. - (PT) [[We]] voted against the final text because, among other issues, it assumed a position of defence of economic and financial [[groups]], as highlighted by the [[rapporteur]] who removed her name from the report before the final vote and called for it to be rejected.

9381	Mr [[President]] of the Commission, the action plan you have just outlined is a well-considered one.	Male
9382	[[I]] am sorry that various concessions had to be made, for example postponing the implementation of important elements, such as the new voting system in the Council, and the British and Irish opt-outs/opt-ins on matters previously covered by the third pillar; I fear that establishing an elected [[President]] of the European Council will mean losing the advantages of the rotating Presidencies without bringing any added value for the functioning of the EU, creating problems in relations between the different institutions.

9387	[[I]] would like to ask the [[Minister]] if his attention has been drawn to the protectionist elements in the plan for recovery in the United States, particularly as put forward by [[members]] of the House of [[Representatives]] and the [[Senate]], and if he has, on behalf of the [[Council]], communicated the concern of the European Union to the American [[Administration]] about this.

9397	Mr [[Hatzidakis]], [[I]] really have to refer to my original reply to the question.	Male,Amb
9398	[[We]] should therefore support the compromise on Article 6 which requires that after a five year period the Council of [[Ministers]] should consider whether it is still necessary to keep data on [[people]] who are granted [[refugee]] status.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb

9404	[[We]] need free range rearing where the [[hens]] can wander across grass and gravel. We need quality products which obviously are a little more expensive, by say two euros per [[person]] per year, but which will reduce the social burden and medical costs.	Amb,Female,Amb
9405	[[I]] should like to know why an exhibition by a lesbian [[artist]] was banned from this Parliament.	Amb,Female
9406	Mr [[President]], NATO's war against Yugoslavia has failed in its declared objective.	Male
9407	Madam [[President]], the compromise proposal is not mine exactly since, as the [[rapporteur]] for the Committee on Budgets, I am obviously bound by the previous vote of the Committee on Budgets.	Female,Amb
9408	If the 1% level is found to be perfectly technically feasible, there are [[many]] in the [[Community]] who want to make sure that it is possible to review that level downwards, and [[we]] would like to have the [[Commission's]] view on that.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb

Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
9515	Mr [[Karlsson]], your presidency has seen the further development of the method for the statement of assurance, and the compilation of a very large number of special reports containing very definite and valuable recommendations.	Male

9523	However, like Mr [[Wieland]], [[I]] take the view that this refers to other articles, all of which I have read and which have nothing to do with the procedure adopted this morning.	Male,Amb

9531	Mrs [[Frassoni]] can take my word for it: nothing like what she fears will actually happen, and none of the standards [[we]] have already achieved will be made less rigorous.	Female,Amb
9532	This is not a circus, and, if Commissioner [[McCreevy]] can make that sort of statement at a time when the European Social Model is in place, then it is incumbent to the [[President]] of the Commission to say, on its behalf, what is acceptable and what is not.	Amb,Amb
9533	Although just 3% of [[people]] employed in extractive fishing are [[women]], women do participate actively in all the other activities relating to fishing.	Female,Female
9534	There has been some talk recently in certain quarters that the [[Commission]] was considering taking action against Ireland for failure to implement new legislation, which is currently going through the national [[parliament]] in Ireland.	Amb,Amb
9535	As [[we]] have already heard, [[women]] are now better educated and there are far more women graduates than male [[graduates]], but we have still not broken through the glass ceiling.	Amb,Female,Male
9536	[[I]] imagine that all of the [[speakers]] are aware that there is an item coming up on our agenda specifically relating to the analysis of the situation in the Middle East, the result of the Palestinian elections and whether or not this report to which Mr [[Wurtz]] has referred should be published.

9548	Mr [[President]], could [[I]] ask the [[speaker]] if, should he be disappointed and the Treaty actually finds itself in force, he would support the appointment of Mr [[Chris Patten]] as the High Representative?	Male,Amb,Male,Male
9549	It is also the Member States' opportunity to show that they are not merely paying lip service to this, but that they do indeed have competent, capable [[candidates]] who are women and who they are prepared to put forward.	Female
9550	This may be a statistical aberration or it may be a situation where, for one reason or another, a greater number of the applications are for male [[workers]].	Male

9553	[[I]] fully support what Mrs [[Wortmann-Kool]] said a few moments ago about our needing a stronger governance method.	Amb,Female
9554	This is why the [[Presidency]] wanted Commissioner [[Oettinger]] to share his initial assessments with [[us]] at the recent Informal Meeting of Energy [[Ministers]] from 6 to 7 September.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
9555	Recently, [[I]] met with the [[head]] of the customs [[authorities]] in Ireland in Dublin Castle, and she told me that one in every five cigarettes - 20% of the cigarettes smoked in Ireland, a small country - actually comes via China, and that when they actually seized them and analysed them, they found a mixture of tobacco and canine excrement.	Amb,Female,Amb
9556	I am there in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Budgets, appointed by the Committee on Budgets to represent it within that body, just as the [[Chair]] of the Committee on Culture and Education represents her committee within that body.	Female

9558	There are now 2, 800 square metres of arable land on the globe for every [[person]].	Amb
9559	[[Madam President]], it is sometimes tragic when the two large [[groups]] in the House agree to delete an important part of an amendment.	Female,Amb
9560	In addition, Commissioner [[Monti]] wrote to the [[minister]] responsible for the internal market in France, drawing his attention, as a matter of urgency, to the fact that he had to secure the conditions necessary for the operation of the internal market.	Amb,Male
9561	Perhaps [[you]] might discuss these cultural differences with Mr [[Ribeiro]] and the [[others]], for whom [[I]] hereby apologize, over a good meal.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
9562	Madam [[President]], Mr [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], the revolting news last week of the public executions of [[those]] who had been sentenced to death in the United Arab Emirates and the impending beheading of two British [[nurses]] found guilty of murder, bring back into the limelight in the most dramatic way the issue of capital punishment and the widespread abuse of basic human rights.	Female,Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
9563	[[I]] am addressing this comment to Sir [[Leon Brittan]] but I also think that the other [[commissioners]] need to consider if in one of the Commission's other Directorates-General there are not perhaps some [[staff]] who could be transferred to remove this bottleneck in DG VIII.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
9564	[[I]] thank the honourable [[Member]] for her question, but I can only refer her to my previous answer which is that there are a number of different ways in which improvement can be brought about.	Amb,Female
9565	If that was heard by the honourable [[Member]], she heard what was not said.	Female

9667	Mr [[President]], firstly, and like other [[Members]], [[I]] would like to congratulate Mrs [[Fourtou]] on her excellent work and also express my regret at the speech by Mr [[Turmes]], who should not really worry about intellectual property since he has only come to criticise Mrs Fourtou and her [[relatives]] and has not been able to remain in this Chamber for the whole debate.

9670	[[I]] find this development in Iran so very disappointing precisely because I was spending a whole week in Iran at the time that [[Ahmadinejad]] took office, and I was still under the illusion that not everything would turn out to be quite so bad as it looked.	Amb,Amb
9671	[[Madam President]], [[I]] thank the [[Commissioner]] and Mr [[Fruteau]] for dealing so well with what is an extremely contentious and difficult issue.	Female,Amb,Amb,Male

9675	My [[group]] will not be advising [[Members]] to vote in favour of Amendments 1 and 2 by Mrs [[Gibault]] and Mr [[Cavada]].	Amb,Amb,Female,Male
9676	[[We]] know that, European [[statesman]] as you are, you are firstly and above all concerned about [[human beings]] and anxious to respect their dignity and freedom.	Amb,Male,Amb
9677	Secondly, since competitiveness requires compatibility, action is needed in specific sectors, such as research and development, energy and the environment, as well as equally specific objectives for creating full employment and good quality jobs, guaranteeing dignity and security for [[people]] in work, and addressing calls for flexibility from both sides of the [[employer]]-[[worker]] relationship by means of measures aiming not just at conciliation but also at worker redeployment.	Amb,Amb,Amb
9678	Mr [[President]], I believe that, as group [[chairman]], I have just as many rights as the [[others]].	Male,Male,Amb
9679	Thank you for this very important question, Mrs [[Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou]].	Female

9683	[[I]] will conclude with one more important point: psychological studies show that female [[prisoners]] find it difficult to adjust to living in close proximity to each other.	Amb,Female
9684	Today, when anyone of [[us]] could become the next [[victim]], the Union needs to act in order to clear away this shameful sore. Not only off Bulgaria but off itself.	Amb,Amb
9685	It has already been stated here that there are more [[women]] undergraduate [[students]] in universities than [[men]]; this is also true of Master's and Doctoral degree [[students]] - there are more women.	Female,Female,Male,Female
9686	[[Member]] of the [[Commission]]. - Madam [[President]], I will try to be as brief as possible.	Amb,Amb,Female
9687	[[We]] also cannot ignore the fact that ever more [[people]] of active age are looking after [[children]] and close elderly [[relatives]] at the same time, leaving them in a precarious position.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
9688	Mr [[Karas]] spoke on the Small Business Act (SBA).	Male
9689	The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs [[Neyts-Uyttebroeck]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on Foreign Affairs, on a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the [[Council]] on the mandate of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.	Female,Amb,Amb
9690	[[I]] can well appreciate what [[you]] have said: a self-employed [[worker]] can work first and then be tired when he gets behind the wheel, but I do not think that a self-employed worker can be controlled in any job.	Amb,Amb,Male
9691	[[I]] am afraid that as long as this does not happen and as long as [[someone]] who was a member of the [[government]] which sanctioned shooting at [[people]] can be Vice-Chairwoman of Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, , [[we]] cannot have any real confidence and the moral authority in another country, to ask for this kind of investigation to be carried out in a country outside the European Union.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
9692	One specific point to be raised - Mrs [[Rühle]] has already raised it - is that of service concessions.	Female
9693	Mr [[President]], Commissioner, Mrs [[Martínez Lozano]], in a recent article published in Time, entitled The New Sheriffs of Wall Street, it states that in the US, [[women]] do not run Wall Street, nor are they to blame for this financial crisis, but that, in the face of the situation brought about through the lack of regulation of financial market, it is they who are now being called upon and appointed to positions of leadership in order to clean up the mess caused by their male [[managers]].	Male,Female,Female,Male
9694	[[I]] would like to pay tribute to [[Michel Dantin]], Mr [[Häusling]], Mr [[Olejniczak]] and [[Jim]] [[Nicholson]], my shadow rapporteurs.	Amb,Amb,Male,Male,Amb,Male
9695	In view of all this, it is hardly surprising if a small [[business]] is forced into bankruptcy due to a lack of liquid assets, especially in periods of economic crisis and recession such as the one [[we]] are now experiencing.	Amb,Amb
9696	Madam [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] should like to thank the [[rapporteur]] for the good work she has done.	Female,Female,Male,Amb,Female
9697	[[I]] did not say that [[you]] should believe the Chinese [[ambassador]]. What I said was that we would be well advised to take our job seriously and to seek dialogue, and then to discuss a resolution.	Amb,Amb,Amb
9698	(IT) Madam [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I am speaking above all to thank all the members of my committee for their good work, particularly Mr [[Lamassoure]] and Mrs [[Gurmai]], who did a great job in achieving the aim of implementing one of the most important changes in the Treaty of Lisbon.	Female,Female,Male,Male,Female
9699	(EL) Madam [[President]], [[I]] wish to comment in particular on the Cyprus question, as presented in Mrs [[Oomen-Ruijten's]] motion for a resolution.	Female,Amb,Female
9700	It relates principally to problems resulting from the addition, using a number of means, of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to breast milk, where it contributes to normal visual development in [[children]] aged up to 12 months.	Amb
9701	The [[Member]] then asked Baroness [[Ashton]], 'Is there a foreign [[minister]] and a phone number he can call now?'	Amb,Amb,Male
9702	When [[you]] add to this the fact that [[we]] have changed the order in which the reports are to be considered in order to fit in with the arrangements of one of our rapporteurs, Mr [[Black]], who is not even present to hear what follows, then you can understand to what extent our procedures may appear surprising.	Amb,Amb,Male
9703	Mr [[President]], our [[group]] is under the same understanding as Mrs [[Green]].	Male,Amb,Female
9704	It is an appalling indictment of international policies that 70 % of the 1.4 billion [[people]] living below the poverty threshold are [[women]].	Female,Female
9705	Mr [[President]], [[I]] share the view of Mrs [[Maij-Weggen]] that the previous [[speaker]], I have often thought, inhabits a rather sad and black world.	Male,Amb,Female,Amb
9706	Madam [[President]], I wanted to speak when Mr [[Novo]] tabled his oral amendment in order to say that I, the [[rapporteur]], agree with the deletion of the limits to which he refers in his oral amendment to Article 18.	Female,Male,Amb
9707	There are not too many genuine [[Europeans]] among the present [[Heads of Government]], and our group [[chairman]] is right that general European interests often come second to small-minded national interests.	Amb,Amb,Male
9708	At the risk of upsetting the honourable [[Member]], [[I]] must say that if a process of ratification and referendum is underway in different countries, it would be dangerous for the [[Presidency]], or the [[Council]], to give interpretations that might be likely to cause misunderstandings in certain countries.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
9709	As a matter of fact, the issue did come up at the ECOFIN Council on two occasions, in November 1996 and again in March 1998, and as the President-in-Office of the ECOFIN Council, Mr [[Gordon Brown]], said publicly on a recent occasion, there is no evidence of an emerging consensus within ECOFIN for any reconsideration of the decision taken unanimously in 1991.	Male
9710	[[I]] admire Mr [[Cook]] for his condemnation of the slaughter in Kosovo.	Amb,Male
9711	Mr [[President]], [[I]] thank the [[Minister]]. Her answer was very extensive and covered all the necessary points, and perhaps that is why it is difficult for me to put a second question.	Male,Amb,Female
9712	[[We]] worked together for many long hours, and came to know her as a [[friend]]. We valued the personal dignity, common sense and spirit of solidarity that always characterised her work and are very sorry that events should have taken such a turn.	Amb,Female
9713	Every [[person]] of sense now knows that the neo-liberal counter-reform has failed.	Amb
9714	Mr [[President]], [[I]] should like to begin by thanking Mrs [[Ferrer]], because I think that this is an extremely important initiative.	Male,Amb,Female
9715	Furthermore, [[they]] have caused distrust amongst [[consumers]], damaged the reputation of the European agricultural and food industries amongst third countries and caused headaches for the [[governments]] of the Member countries. I can confirm this as a former [[head]] of food policy in Spain.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
9716	We always face the same problem, and [[I]] can remember our discussing that, Mr [[Lange]]: you promised to come to an arrangement with the [[Council]] so that your amendments would be accepted in part.	Amb,Male,Amb

9810	As it happens, our [[rapporteur]] is urging [[us]] to do so, and [[I]] shall follow his lead.	Male,Amb,Amb
9811	Mr [[President]], [[we]] must thank the [[Commission]] and the [[President-in-Office]] of the Council for including this vital issue in the weekly priorities, in particular at a time - as Mrs [[Díez]] reminded us - when the European Council has just proclaimed the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

9813	Mr [[President]], Mr [[Byrne]], [[I]] disagree with you on one key point, namely that we cannot yet discuss the measures to be adopted once the current crisis has been brought under control.	Male,Male,Amb
9814	For this, however, the [[farmer]] would have to receive an additional compensatory payment corresponding to the extent of the voluntary reduction.	Amb
9815	However, merely operating the transport sector is fraught with danger. Danger to the economy and, of course, to [[human]] life, dangerous working conditions and, of course, huge environmental dangers.	Amb
9816	However, [[we]] will not give our support to amendments put forward a posteriori, because we think that some, such as those put forward by Mr [[Mulder]], should be dealt with in another context, although, it must be said, we are not against what he is saying.	Amb,Male
9817	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], there is a saying that what is good is worth waiting for, and Mr [[Graefe zu Baringdorf]], the rapporteur, has referred clearly to the never-ending story of the matter under discussion.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Male
9818	But like Mr [[Savary]] [[I]] believe - and this is why I have presented this modified proposal and have continued to insist - that [[we]] have to seek a midpoint which will clearly not satisfy [[anybody]], but which may provide a balance which reasonably takes account of the different interests involved.

9822	[[I]] would like to thank Mrs [[McNally]] once again for her wonderful work and the honourable [[Members]] for their attention.	Amb,Female,Amb
9823	Furthermore, since [[we]] are lucky enough to have a woman [[Commissioner]] here today, and since we know that the fifth framework programme has set aside EUR 400 million, why not make cancer a major priority in Europe from 2004, Commissioner?	Amb,Female
9824	Mr [[Wurtz]] said that the [[Commission]] has discretionary power in the field of competition which is not subject to control.	Male,Amb
9825	The European industry has been demanding a regulation of this type for a long time; it follows our work very closely and [[I]] believe that [[everybody]] considers what [[we]] can achieve tonight and tomorrow, in the vote, to be a good agreement – earlier Mr [[Glante]] said that ‘it does a little harm to [[everyone]]’, perhaps that is partly why it is a good agreement.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
9826	Lastly, all of these factors prompted our [[colleague]] from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to write in his report, and [[I]] quote: ‘Meeting the political criteria of Copenhagen is a precondition for opening accession negotiations’.	Male,Amb
9827	[[I]] should like to assure Mr [[Piecyk]] that the requirements for obtaining a driving licence in both the Czech Republic and Poland are a great deal more stringent than merely passing the .	Amb,Male
9828	This must be made clear and, in this respect, the [[Commissioner]] has been rather more forthright in her comments than Mr [[Solana]] in recent weeks.	Female,Male
9829	Other [[bodies]] involved in the [[committee’s]] work include the [[coordinators]], who play a key statutory role, and who perform their task very competently.	Amb,Amb,Amb
9830	The [[rapporteur]] emphasises the need for preventive care, improved long-term treatment, and on the need to help [[patients]] by improving the much-needed exchange of information between Member States, and [[I]] agree with him in this.	Male,Amb,Amb
9831	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], the has reported that, following Thursday’s meeting between Mr [[Mandelson]] and the Chinese Trade [[Minister]], Mr Mandelson reaffirmed that he does not plan to make hasty decisions in confronting the influx of Chinese products, ‘The long-term stakes are too high to allow the Chinese to damage our partnership and a longer deadline is required to make the suitable adjustments.’ Even here today, in this House, when faced with the request from certain countries, including Italy, to take urgent steps to activate the safeguard mechanism, you tell [[us]] that you are examining the dossier.	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Male,Amb,Amb
9832	Mr [[President-in-Office]], you have today confirmed your skills as a performer and a charmer, qualities that you might teach to some of our [[friends]], my fellow countrymen, on one of your many visits to Italy.	Male,Male
9833	In no Member State of the Union has it been the case that the influx of [[workers]] from the new Member States has ousted local [[workers]] from their jobs.	Amb,Amb
9834	Thirdly, and simply because Mrs [[Gräßle]] has such a nice way of applauding, [[we]] should, in dealing with the statement of assurance, take to heart what Mr [[Wynn]] said earlier on.	Female,Amb,Male
9835	[[I]] thank the [[Commissioner]] for all his work.	Amb,Male
9836	Finally, both the report by Mr [[Bullmann]] and the report by Mr [[Andersson]] express the need for [[Parliament]] to be able to exercise its prerogatives properly when it comes to revising the integrated guidelines of the Lisbon Strategy, which is scheduled for next year.	Male,Male,Amb

9840	[[We]] have just seen in the Committee on Foreign Affairs how angry Serbia is, how angry the [[Minister]] for Foreign Affairs is, how aggressive his attitude was.	Amb,Male
9841	For it is only here that you, my dear [[colleagues]], can find the delicate balance between the interests of your [[electors]] and the interests of the Union.	Amb,Amb
9842	In any case, the situation in Darfur and the neighbouring areas of Chad and the Central African Republic require a well thought-out, coherent policy, politically driven, that would include the imposition of a no-fly zone - a task that only an [[organisation]] such as NATO is competent to undertake.	Amb
9843	Firstly, although [[we]] must welcome the fact that President [[Sarkozy]] is becoming increasingly vocal and is not excluding boycotting the Olympic Games, the attitude of his Foreign Affairs [[Minister]] is more than questionable.	Amb,Male,Amb
9844	in writing. - (ES) My abstention in relation to this report is because, although pragmatic rules for the creation of parliamentary [[groups]] are certainly necessary, [[I]] feel that the proposed number of [[members]] and of Member States is too high.	Amb,Amb,Amb

In some areas [[we]] would like to go further and, therefore, in the next few weeks we will be holding constructive discussions in order to find a positive solution.	Amb,Female,Amb
9852	My vote is confirmation that, in this time of difficulty and crisis, the [[person]] most suited and qualified to direct the ECB has been elected.	Amb
9853	Mr [[Herman]] was right to say so in his introduction; he made it clear in presenting his long and painstaking report which is an important document, indeed fundamental, at an important time for information, and which has our support.

9859	This paragraph calls on a [[judge]] at the European Court of Justice to resign his European post due to his earlier personal decision when he was Minister for Justice to permit the early release of [[Marc Diedres]] who is suspected of multiple [[child]] murders.	Male,Amb,Amb
9860	Another [[group]] it is difficult to cater for as far as further training is concerned is [[people]] working in non-standard employment relationships, of whom most are [[women]].	Amb,Female,Female
9861	[[I]] should like to say to the honourable [[Member]] that I am not just full of hope but I am full of expectation as well, and of course you will appreciate that all these changes will depend on the programmes that are submitted from the Member States when they look for assistance insofar as the promotion of equal opportunities are concerned.	Amb,Amb
9862	Perhaps for once the [[President]] of the sitting could add his congratulations to all those who have enabled this difficult report to come to fruition, in particular Lord [[Simon]], Commissioner [[Monti]] and our rapporteur Mr [[Medina Ortega]], as well as Mrs [[Fontaine]], who chaired our [[delegation]].

9866	However, the [[public's]] right to information is just as legitimate and important, as is the development of an information [[society]] available to [[all]].	Amb,Amb,Amb

10102	[[I]] would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr [[Savary]], on his report and for succeeding in getting the directive on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system through the various hoops of the parliamentary system.	Amb,Male
10103	[[I]] would agree with Mr [[Swoboda]] when he says that the [[staff]] currently feel great concern, despite your attempts to reassure [[us]] by telling us that it is only a minority.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
10104	As a result, it is often more sensible for [[Members]] from southern Germany and from France, for example, to employ an [[assistant]] for Strasbourg and for their constituency than to bring the Brussels [[assistant]] to Strasbourg.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10105	Mr [[President]], on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, [[I]] welcome this reform of the 1996 Equal Treatment Directive and congratulate Mrs [[Hautala]] on her truly immense work to achieve a consensus in this House.	Male,Amb,Female
10106	[[I]] find this a grave discourtesy to the [[Members]] of this House who signed that letter and I also find it astonishing that a [[minister]] in the EU presidency should come before a packed meeting of an [[intergroup]] and say that she has written to me when she knew full well that this was a lie and no letter had been sent.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
10107	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to tell the [[rapporteur]] that he is mistaken.	Male,Amb,Male
10108	Mr [[President]] - [[I]] am delighted to see you perched so high up there, if I may say so - Madam [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], I should like to thank the rapporteur, [[Per Gahrton]], for the many efforts he has made to try and bring this report up to an acceptable level.	Male,Amb,Female,Female,Male,Male
10109	Mrs [[Kaufmann]] thought just now that there were more than a hundred, so [[I]] do not know how things are precisely, but those 23 pages are very interesting.	Female,Amb
10110	Since my [[assistant]] had no jacket or tie on, he was asked to leave the hearing and was therefore unable to do his work, a fact [[I]] am very unhappy about.	Male,Amb
10111	But in a report published by Euro NGOs, the [[representative]] of [[Marie Stopes]] states that her organisation is a major provider of abortion that is working with Vietnam and in other countries where abortion may be illegal.	Female,Female
10112	One British [[minister]] admitted that the trade [[unions]] and the Confederation of British Industry in the UK had more influence on the national action plans on employment than the British [[Parliament]], which had never ever discussed them - although that situation is now changing, since the new [[Committee]] on Works and Pensions came into being - what an exciting name that is.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10113	[[Madam President]], [[I]] should like to extend a warm thanks to the [[rapporteur]] for the work she has done.	Female,Amb,Female
10114	Mr [[Wynn]] asked what the purpose of this amendment was.	Male
10115	It was in early January 2002 that [[Marta Andreasen]] started work for the Commission, and five months into 2002 that she was suspended from her role as an accounting officer for the Commission.	Female
10116	In fact, [[you]] are not awarding this prize just to [[me]], but to the Kurdish [[people]], to the Turkish people, who are our brothers; you have in fact awarded it to Turkey and to the [[defenders]] of peace, equality, freedom and fraternity.	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
10117	[[We]] renew our trust in Mr [[Barroso]] in the certainty that his choices and the appointments made by the [[governments]] will comply with the [[people’s]] call for a transparent [[Commission]] that respects the principle of subsidiarity and is able to uphold [[everyone’s]] rights, within the context of the overall interests of [[society]] from a European viewpoint, but also in the interests of the rest of the world.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10118	The European [[Institutions]] cannot turn a blind eye to this shocking [[figure]].	Amb,Amb
10119	An example is the eradication of malaria, as recommended by the [[director]] of the United Nations Millennium Project, because malaria strikes above all at the poorest countries with devastating effect, causing incalculable economic damage.	Amb
10120	Mr [[President]], in my view this text improves the accuracy of the report and as [[rapporteur]] I am happy to strongly support it.	Male,Amb
10121	It is, then, to give one example, contrary to the spirit of the Regulation for German [[employers]] to be required to grapple with an intolerable amount of red tape in order to remit to Poland social security contributions totalling 47.85% (20.64% from the employer, 27.27% from the [[employee]]) of the earnings of Polish seasonal [[workers]], particularly when, under German law, no such contributions were payable in respect of their work prior to the accession of Poland to the EU.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10122	– Mr [[President]], [[I]] should like to congratulate the [[rapporteur]] on her work, as it shows clearly how many different issues [[we]] are actually talking about when we use the expression ‘sustainable development strategy’.	Male,Amb,Female,Amb
10123	They would give you, Mr [[President]], powers that are far smaller than the powers of, for instance, the [[Speaker]] of the House of Commons; they are strictly circumscribed and are combined with safeguards to reassure those [[colleagues]] who feared that [[we]] were going to clamp down on any kind of behaviour that was in any way colourful or lively.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
10124	It was in part this undertaking that meant that she was eventually considered an acceptable [[candidate]] by a [[majority]] in this [[House]].	Female,Amb,Amb
10125	The German or Irish [[regulators]] appear to play no role, but that does not help the EU [[citizen]], for whom it is impractical, inconvenient and costly to pursue concerns with the British [[regulator]], even supposing he were interested.	Amb,Male,Amb
10126	[[We]] have made proposals, as Mrs [[Hübner]] knows, and we are now waiting for practical responses to help these countries to use this money properly.	Amb,Female
10127	Madam [[President]], honourable [[Members]], allow [[me]], at this point, to make a brief comment on behalf of the [[Council]] and express how very depressing this topic is for all of us.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
10128	Mr [[President]], [[I]] welcome this report from my colleague Mr [[Cornillet]].	Male,Amb,Male
10129	As a result, as [[I]] have said, it is therefore willing to pay particular attention to any proposals made by the [[Commission]] to the [[Council]] in this respect.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10130	on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr [[President]], in the past few months my fellow [[Members]] and [[I]] have met a great many [[representatives]] of the motor industry.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
10131	On the demand side, Mr [[Tatarella]], who is no longer with [[us]], and Mr [[Howitt]] raised the problem of overproduction: the fact that the opium currently available actually exceeds demand for processing into opiates for drugs.	Male,Amb,Male
10132	[[Rapporteur]] for endorsement Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (RO) Mr. [[President]], Mr. [[Commissioners]], dear [[colleagues]], as rapporteur for the ITRE opinion, I can tell you that the directive has been intensively debated in our committee as well.	Amb,Male,Male,Amb
10133	If [[you]] listen to what Ms [[McGuinness]] and Mr [[Graefe zu Baringdorf]] said this morning, it shows the difference in interpretation in different Member States.	Amb,Female,Male
10134	Because if [[we]] organise sessions where we discuss the application of directives and the Commission [[official]] who attends remains silent or tells us things that are of little interest - perhaps because he cannot say what we really want to know - then the whole exercise becomes pointless.	Amb,Male
10135	Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - Mr [[President]], many congratulations to the [[rapporteur]] for her excellent work.	Male,Female
10136	As the [[Minister]] is on home territory and the role of the Presidency is to lead the 27 countries for this six-month period, could he indicate any areas where he feels that France sets a particularly good example and leads the way for the rest of the European Union in this field?	Male
10137	These 'bridge-between-generation' centres, which operate successfully in some Member States, would allow [[women]] who have had a [[child]] to return to work quite soon, while also making it easier for elderly retired [[people]] to return to employment.	Female,Amb,Amb
10138	In her recent meeting with the Sri Lankan Foreign [[Minister]], Commissioner [[Ferrero-Waldner]] called upon the [[Government]] of Sri Lanka to take decisive action to tackle human rights abuses, including action against the [[perpetrators]], and to guarantee press freedom.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
10139	(The [[President]] reminded the [[speaker]] of her speaking time)	Amb,Female
10140	As a [[representative]] of one of the poorest Member States in the European Union, I urge that one of the focuses of the cohesion policy will be cohesion between low-income Member States.	Amb
10141	Just a couple of days ago, the French [[Prime Minister]] and the German [[Chancellor]] even agreed to change the treaty to bring in tougher sanctions against countries that threaten the euro's stability.	Amb,Amb
10142	[[They]] must be able to decide when they wish to take the non-compulsory part of their maternity leave.	Female
10143	This does not only apply to irregular, false and aggressive advertisements, but also to advertisements in general, as [[we]] live in a new world where [[people]] are faced with the overwhelming pressure to fit in with the [[consumer]] society already at an early age.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10144	[[I]] would like to ask Mrs [[Győri]] to take the floor on behalf of the [[Vice-President]] of the Commission and High [[Representative]].	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
10145	Let [[us]] also remember that the past [[winners]] of the Sakharov Prize include magnificent women such as [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], [[Leyla Zana]] and the [[Ladies]] in White.	Amb,Female,Female,Female,Female
10146	So Baroness [[Catherine Ashton]] will have the opportunity to wage her first war and put her name up there with the greats of military history such as [[Rommel]], [[Montgomery]] and [[Eisenhower]].	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
10147	Madam [[President]], [[I]] have only a minute to tell you how happy I am with these reports, and that I congratulate the [[rapporteurs]], particularly the most political of them, Mr [[Mendiluce Pereiro]].	Female,Amb,Amb,Male
10148	[[I]] would like to know under what Rule Mrs [[Green]] spoke and was called to speak.	Amb,Female
10149	If a [[Member]] of this Parliament, as an individual citizen of the vast legal area that is the European Union, happened to come into contact with such an information system and objected to the data held on him there, he could not bring a complaint before the European Court of Justice, because - surprisingly - the information system would be outside the ECJ's jurisdiction.	Male
10150	If there is a transfer of power in favour of our future Scottish [[colleague]] who will be in charge of fishing, there will not be a problem, even if he belongs to a different [[party]] from the [[prime minister]].	Male,Amb,Amb
10151	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would first of all like to congratulate both the [[rapporteur]] and the [[Committee]] on Transport and Tourism on their initiative in encouraging the European Parliament to deal with tourism. This approach has been quite different to the tactic used by the [[Commission]] which, by totally downplaying this extremely important sector, has not deigned to deal with an action plan essentially rejecting the PHILOXENIA programme.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10152	On agriculture, the policies applied in this budget do nothing to correct the unfair imbalances between different types of agriculture and [[farmers]].	Amb
10153	The [[Commission]] has concluded that the only modification likely to bring about true simplification consists of abolishing this procedure altogether and replacing it with a mechanism enabling a taxable [[person]] to deduct, in his regular returns, tax paid in a Member State in which he is not resident.	Amb,Male
10154	[[I]] would therefore ask [[you]] to give a round of applause to thank all our female [[colleagues]] in the House and particularly the [[members]] of the Committee on Women's Rights.	Amb,Amb,Female,Female
10155	The Group of [[Independents]] for a Europe of Nations has asked for the report by Mrs [[Miranda de Lage]] on the cooperation agreement between the European Community and the United Mexican States to be withdrawn from the agenda.	Amb,Female
10156	Mrs. [[Miller]]	Female
10157	Young [[Frankenstein]]	Amb
10158	[[Jan]] and [[Dean]]	Amb,Amb
10159	The [[Virgin]] Tour	Female

10162	21 einflussreiche [[Frauen]] berichten aus der Wirklichkeit.	Female
10163	Hupp Motor Car Company continued to grow after its [[founder]] left.	Amb
10164	As cultural [[manager]] and curator, [[she]] is committed to international understanding and cultural exchange and organizes every year in northwestern Bulgaria an international cultural festival.	Female,Female
10165	As [[director]], he founded the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies at the Center and seven other new programs as well as the Wilson Quarterly.	Male
10166	He's a young, energetic [[cat]], so being able to work with him, with the [[fanbase]] he has, was incredible.	Male,Amb
10167	[[She]] is the [[founder]] of the Safe Motherhood Quilt Project, a national effort developed to draw public attention to the current maternal death rates, and to honor those [[women]] who have died of pregnancy-related causes during the past twenty years.	Female,Female,Female
10168	[[Marek]] and her [[husband]] were acquitted of fraud in 1927 and sentenced to only a small prison sentence, as [[Martha]] had tried to bribe or slander the [[coroners]].	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
10169	1994 saw the [[designer]] re-launch her label Stefi Talman in Zürich.	Female
10170	The first episode of the third series had the highest-ever [[audience]] for an E4 original commission.	Amb
10171	Recording under the pseudonym Porcelain and the Tramps, [[Black]] worked with [[Tommy Henriksen]] and [[John Lowery]] in London while at Virgin.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10172	The Bamum [[nobles]] had been scattered due to the French occupation, but they eventually chose [[Njimoluh]] from among [[Ibrahim Njoya's]] 177 [[children]] and reached an agreement with the French [[authorities]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10173	The intensive [[teacher]]–[[pupil]] relationship existed only in private gatherings and meetings.	Amb,Amb
10174	The fact that [[Albert]] depicted his wife beside him on coins, is a sign of his extraordinary love for [[Sophie]].	Male,Female
10175	On November 13, 2015, [[Page]] released her second studio album The Ethereal Blues, which she self-produced and released on her own label.	Female
10176	Between 1899 and 1901, [[Hogg]] attended the University of Texas at Austin; she then moved to New York City to study piano and music theory for two years.	Female
10177	In December 1993, [[Angel]] opened her own studio, Rings of Desire, in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana.	Female
10178	Following further reprimand, [[Daly]] absented herself from classes rather than admit the male [[students]].	Female,Male
10179	In 2004, [[she]] was an [[assistant]] of Dutch Head Coach [[Marc Lammers]] at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, when the Netherlands won silver.	Female,Female,Amb
10180	His private [[students]] included the composer [[Fernand Oubradous]].	Amb,Amb
10181	While her roles were hardly predisposed to have made her a [[star]], she nonetheless was one of the more famous (or infamous) and durable [[stars]] of Filipino films.	Female,Amb
10182	[[Isabella]] set about expanding her own lands after her victory, and took St Briavels Castle and various other royal castles into her own possession.	Female
10183	As [[teacher]] of the university [[he]] had imparted in his lectures and seminars to the necessary knowledge of instruction religious teachings during three decades generations of studying for the teaching profession in the different school stages.	Male,Male
10184	His assistant is Lieutenant [[Green]].	Amb
10185	In 1860, the Eifel’s biggest lava deposit – the Feuerberg in Hohenfels – was leased by the [[municipality]] for lava mining.	Amb
10186	On 12 June 2006, the [[Secretary]] of Defense announced that President [[George W. Bush]] had nominated [[Natonski]] for appointment to the rank of lieutenant general, to be assigned as the Deputy Commandant, Plans, Policies, and Operations.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10187	A public [[speaker]] known for her sense of humour, she played a leading role in the successful Liberal campaign in 1914.	Female
10188	[[Miller]] later retracted his statements.	Male
10189	This led to the launch in 2000 of his company NewMindsets Inc, and his research and activities as an internet [[entrepreneur]].	Male
10190	[[Kim]] witnessed more than 100 public executions per year with [[prisoners]] being tortured and then shot or hanged as a deterrent to the other [[prisoners]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
10191	On 4 November, 2010, the new [[singer]] was announced on De Laatste Show at the VRT, the Flemish public broadcasting organization.	Amb
10192	On May 25, 1503, Archbishop [[Ernest]] could move into the imposing castle.	Male
10193	Between the vulnerable sixteen-year-old, [[Sophie Dorothea]], who had married into the House Hanover, and [[Eleanor]] a friendly relationship developed, a sort of mother-daughter relationship, and she was a confidante in the extra-marital love affair of her [[mistress]] with the reckless [[Count]] of Königsmarck, serving as a letter bearer.	Female,Female,Female,Male
10194	Her father was the reigning British monarch, [[George III]], the eldest son of [[Frederick]], Prince of Wales and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha.	Male,Male
10195	In a prayer, [[Iphigenia]] thanks [[Diana]] and asks that [[Orestes]] may be released from the curse.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10196	[[Rose]] then compared himself to a [[lawyer]], who was opponent of the death penalty and insets in the art and to the Government for their elimination: "If he does not succeed, it will remain as still in the profession and in its surroundings there, and he can even be may be forced to utter such a death sentence even though he basically is an opponent of this institution."	Male,Male
10197	Following this, [[Cox]] directed a short film set in Liverpool for the BBC titled I'm a Juvenile Delinquent – Jail Me! (2004).	Amb
10198	After the birth of their seventh [[child]] in January 1828, [[Maria]] fell ill and died of tuberculosis on 23 November at the age of 41.	Amb,Amb
10199	In 1901, [[Ben-Yusuf]] wrote an article, "Celebrities Under the Camera", for the Sunday Evening Post, where she described her experiences with her [[sitters]].	Female,Amb
10200	After becoming [[mayor]] in 1981, [[she]] led the successful effort to ban drinking in public places in Port Augusta.	Female,Female
10201	One long narrow room in the tower was fitted out as an "oratory", where the paintings were all of devotional subjects and a marble [[Virgin]] and [[Child]] stood bathed in light from a hidden skylight.	Female,Amb
10202	[[Whoever]] eventually answered the question correctly won the remaining money.	Amb
10203	In between trance and wakefulness, [[Valdemar]] begs the [[narrator]] to quickly put him back to sleep or to wake him.	Amb,Male
10204	In contrast, the original [[figure]] in [[Hinterberger's]] mid-1960s book Das Salz der Erde on which he based the series is a pitiful man in the throes of midlife crisis, who notices while on holiday in Italy that his control over his [[family]] is dissolving.	Male,Male,Amb
10205	More recently, [[she]] has been [[director]] of the annual Richard Strauss Festival in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.	Female,Female
10206	Even if [[he]] possessed such power, those [[tribunals]] would either have to be sanctioned by the "laws of war", as codified by [[Congress]] in Article 21 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), or authorized by statute.	Male,Amb,Amb
10207	[[Smith]] co-owned the business with his [[brother]].	Male,Male
10208	As a [[child]], she often listened to music with her [[parents]] and [[grandmother]], including "[[2Pac]], [[Rakim]] and [[Miles Davis]]."	Female,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
10209	[[Smith]] then dictated another revelation stating that the church was presently unworthy to "redeem Zion" because of its lack of commitment to the United Order, or Law of Consecration.	Amb
10210	In his treatise "Über Lärm und Geräusch" ("about noises and sounds") of 1851, [[he]] wrote down his anger especially about "das vermaledeite infernale Peitschenknallen" ("the damned infernal whip cracks") of the [[waggoners]] in the reverberating alleys of the cities: "With all due respect to the most holy usefulness, [[I]] do not accept that a [[guy]], who moves a carriage of sand or dung to another place, should in return gain the privilege to scotch any upcoming thought in ten thousand minds on their half-hour route through the city."	Male,Amb,Male,Male
10211	[[White]] was given five minutes, [[black]] four.	Amb,Amb
10212	It was the publication of the latter's "On Government" which called for the vote for [[men]] only, that aroused the fervent opposition of both [[Wheeler]] and [[Thompson]] and to the rebuttal in Appeal of One Half the Human Race... (see Bibliography for full title).	Male,Amb,Amb
10213	It is not the first time [[she's]] had these prophetic nightmares.	Female
10214	Another [[baby]] was stabbed by a [[man]] trying to kill her [[mother]].	Female,Male,Female
10215	In 1974 [[Haworth]] and wife [[Sally]] became Christians and this life-changing experience brought a strong gospel influence into his music.	Male,Female
10216	[[Charles]] delegated increasing responsibility for Germany to his brother [[Ferdinand]] while he concentrated on problems elsewhere.	Male,Male
10217	The [[star]] of Hollywood comedies had not been seen for days and it was presumed she had been dead for some time.	Female
10218	This prayer includes a mention of [[God's]] healing of the [[sick]] and resurrection of the [[dead]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
10219	After her [[husband's]] death during the American Civil War, [[she]] worked as a school [[teacher]] in Franklin, Louisiana.	Male,Female,Female

10222	[[Black]] cites that [[Spears]] inspires her deep love for choreography, while [[Manson]] inspires the sound and attitude of her lyrics and performance style.	Female,Amb,Amb
10223	[[Olga]] successfully rescues it, and is exhilarated by the realisation that she has, by this action, saved [[Viktor's]] life.	Female,Amb
10224	[[Someone]] planted a car bomb and one [[person]] has died. On behalf of my [[Group]], [[I]] once again condemn these terrorist acts.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10225	For example, if a [[Minister]] goes down on his knees, cut his wrists and writes a pledge in letters of blood that he will deliver the habitats directive in full within an agreed timetable, is [[she]] prepared to assist the region and provide structural funding in such circumstances?	Male,Female
10226	I am already a [[politician]]: I could become an astronaut, the first pensioner astronaut of the European Union.	Amb
10227	For my own part, [[I]] contributed with my [[colleagues]] in the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, to dispelling an impression which prevailed notably among certain third country [[delegations]], that, for the [[women]] of the European Union, in terms of gender equality, sexual orientation and abortion were the absolute priorities in the 21st century.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
10228	Madam [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]] of the House, [[I]] have listened with great interest to the speeches by the [[representatives]] of the various [[groups]] and I am pleased to have this opportunity to express a few thoughts on these.	Female,Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
10229	This is not only the defence of a [[person]] who suffers for having fought for democracy and freedom, but also of what she represents in a whole [[population' s]] fight to achieve those things.	Female,Amb
10230	In all contacts with the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea, the European Union has emphasised its great concern about the serious violations of human rights in the country, about the number of political [[prisoners]], about the absence of national legislation and about the Korean [[authorities']] refusal to cooperate with international mechanisms in defence of human rights.	Amb,Amb
10231	[[I]] would like to thank the [[rapporteur]] for all the work and the research she has carried out.	Amb,Female
10232	Madam [[President]], [[I]] would firstly like to welcome Mrs [[Lindh]].	Female,Amb,Female
10233	[[Madam President]], yesterday evening at the asparagus festival - which [[I]] attended and for which I thank the [[Mayor]] of Strasbourg for having invited [[us]] and you, Madam President, for having agreed and coordinated this important annual event of friendship - I found I was sharing a table with a retired [[judge]].	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10234	This mosque was destroyed - like hundreds of other Muslim and Catholic places of worship - on the orders of [[Karadzic]] and his [[henchmen]].	Male,Male
10235	I also promised my French colleague, Mrs [[Fourtou]], that I would again voice some of these reservations today, although I am a committed [[supporter]] of fair competition in the internal market and always speak up for European regulations whenever they make sense in terms of the internal market and our common integration policy.	Female,Amb
10236	[[Madam President]], in July with my colleagues Mr [[Galeote]], Mr [[Laschet]] and Mr [[Morillon]] [[I]] had the opportunity to visit the Middle East.	Female,Male,Male,Male,Amb
10237	Our thoughts are with President [[Bush]] and the [[people]] he leads.	Male,Amb
10238	[[I]] am convinced that, if such a brutal form of mutilation as this had been forced upon our male fellow [[Members]], the issue would have been resolved long ago.	Amb,Male
10239	[[We]] have divided the priorities which need to be set by the programme into five individual areas so that we can study the question of equal pay and move on to the question highlighted by several lady [[Members]], that is, the need for an integrated strategy.	Amb,Female
10240	[[Madam President]], [[I]] wish to congratulate [[Parliament]] and, in particular, its Conciliation [[Committee]] and the rapporteur, Mr [[Miller]], on their success in reaching an agreement with the [[Council]] on this very important directive.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
10241	[[I]] should therefore like to ask the [[Commissioner]] what initiatives she intends to take on this score and urge her to adopt a pro-active stance on this.	Amb,Female
10242	This is the fundamental misunderstanding that Mr [[Berthu]] has described in his minority opinion.	Male
10243	[[Members]] who sit on the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, with Mrs [[Ayuso]], have disregarded party boundaries in trying to point the [[Commission]] proposal in a more balanced direction.	Amb,Female,Amb
10244	Mr [[President]], Mr [[President-in-Office of the]] Council, [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], our relations with Russia give [[me]] the impression that the values on which the European Union is founded, and which also apply to relations with Russia, are increasingly being sold down the river.	Male,Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb
10245	That is the main political lesson that [[I]] should like to draw from the examination of the reports by Mr [[Mastorakis]] and Mr [[Pomés Ruiz]], in other words the agreement which unites our two institutions on the fundamental ambition of a policy for [[everyone]], a policy that is territorial and visible and which serves the interests of Community priorities.	Amb,Male,Male,Amb
10246	Like the [[rapporteur]], [[I]] believe that the [[Commission]] proposal must contribute to the smoother operation of the internal market.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10247	– Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would like to echo the thanks expressed to the rapporteur, Mr [[Bowis]].	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Male
10248	Only one-third of school [[children]] are girls.	Female
10249	Yes, the majority of university and college [[students]] are women.	Female
10250	Mr [[President]], the rapporteur, Mr [[Goebbels]], laments the lack of coordination of economic policies.	Male,Male
10251	As [[President]] of the Eurogroup, I shall work to ensure proper application and judicious interpretation of the Pact which, in future, will pay greater heed to its two equally vital dimensions, namely stability, combined with growth, and growth allied to stability.	Amb
10252	[[I]] think it is most necessary that [[we]] as the European Union say that this should not be allowed to happen in a country that currently holds the [[chair]] in the Council of Europe’s Committee of [[Ministers]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10253	[[I]] am sorry that the [[representative]] of the [[Council]] has repeated that language and that lack of balance in her introduction this morning.	Amb,Female,Amb
10254	The [[student]] uprising at the Polytechnic is - thirty-three years on - a shining example of the right of the [[peoples]] for democracy within universities and of the need for radical changes to be made at this level.	Amb,Amb
10255	Free movement of [[individuals]] also creates opportunities for the abuse of driving licences: having lost permission to drive because of an infringement in his own country, an EU [[citizen]] can get a driving licence in another country.	Amb,Male
10256	[[I]] would also like, speaking on behalf of this House, to express the same solidarity with the German [[citizen]] and her [[son]], both of whom were abducted in Iraq in February.	Amb,Female,Male
10257	(CS) [[I]] too should like to congratulate Mr [[Trakatellis]] and thank him for his report and his proposals.	Amb,Male
10258	As for the report, it uses this technical pseudo-simplification in an attempt to authorise multiple candidacies, in other words the appearance of the same [[candidate]] in several countries, something that would give an inordinate advantage under common law to foreign [[residents]] only, and it tries to bypass the laws of the Members States where ineligibility is concerned.	Amb,Amb
10259	In fact, she stated the truth, because she is a [[Christian]].	Female
10260	Perhaps Mrs [[Hübner]] can say whether the [[Commission]] is completely ready for these three islands with a total [[population]] of 19 000 to be accepted by [[us]] as a whole.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
10261	In your explanatory statement, Mrs [[Jordan Cizelj]], you say that, in general, industry in the EU is healthy and dynamic.	Female
10262	[[author]]. - (ES) Mr [[President]], as I was saying, according to the Campaign for Human Rights, Peace and Democracy in Burma, on 12 March, the oldest Burmese political [[prisoner]] spent her 78th birthday in solitary confinement at Insein prison.	Amb,Male,Female
10263	[[I]] think I can say, therefore, that Mr [[Cappato]] has produced a good piece of work here, even though - as [[we]] are accustomed to - suggestions for improvement may perhaps come from other [[groups]].	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
10264	President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] only allowed the Nobel Peace Prize [[winner]] to enter the country after strong protests from his own [[people]].	Amb,Male,Amb
10265	[[Member]] of the [[Commission]]. - Madam [[President]], I think that this debate was very important because it made very clear that there is a strong agreement in this House, a strong agreement that the freedom of the press does not have an if or a when, it is the basis of our European Union.	Amb,Amb,Female
10266	Last but not least, as a [[person]] who has been working for [[women's]] equal political representation over the last 15 years, I would be glad if this [[person]] were a woman.	Amb,Female,Female
10267	Agriculture must therefore be central to the debate in Copenhagen, and [[I]] hope that the [[members]] of the Council and of the Commission will not forget this and will be our spokesmen in Copenhagen, in December.	Amb,Male
10268	The problem is that, under Rule 116, if a [[Member]] is not in his place at the point at which a question should be replied to, then the question lapses.	Male
10269	The next item is the report by Mrs [[Giannakou]] on behalf of the [[Committee]] on Constitutional Affairs, on the application of Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 on the regulations governing political [[parties]] at European level and the rules regarding their funding (A7-0062-2011).	Female,Amb,Amb
10270	(IT) Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] ask my fellow [[Member]] if thousands of deaths are not a matter to think over and reflect on for a long time, seeing as she just said that [[we]] do not have sufficient reason to believe that nuclear power is dangerous.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Female,Amb
10271	There is one more thing that [[I]] would like to point out: from this September, [[we]] could use not just cars, but bicycles as well, and through you, Madam [[Vice-President]], I would like to invite Mr [[Buzek]] to officially launch this bicycle scheme in September.	Amb,Amb,Female,Male
10272	(SK) [[Madam President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], Russia still requires a two-handed approach: on the one hand, firm demands for the fulfilment of democratic principles, but, at the same time, a rejection of [[Bush's]] well-honed anti-Russian policy.	Female,Amb,Female,Male,Amb
10273	Mr [[Caccavale]] was rather dismissive and [[I]] would say to him that in a meeting of the consultative [[commission]] on racism and xenophobia set up by [[Helmut Kohl]] and [[François Mitterrand]] the vote in favour of the principle was 14 to 0 with 1 abstention.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10274	Mrs [[Péry]] mentions many of the things that could be done: improvements in the gear that is used, to allow many smaller [[fish]] to escape; improvements such as inserting square-mesh panels in nets.	Female,Amb
10275	Is it the [[President]] or the [[Vice-President]] or the [[Secretary of State]] or is it the [[Chairman]] of the National Security Council, or is it [[Congress]] or is it some special [[envoy]]?	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10276	There is also provision for actions directed specifically at female [[heads]] of [[family]] and to protect the environment.	Female,Female
10277	The territorial pacts have been specifically mentioned by many of the [[Members]] who have contributed today.	Amb
10278	This issue caused some problems today between [[myself]] and some [[members]] of [[staff]], and I do not want a repeat of this.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10279	[[I]] would like to thank the [[Commissioner]] for his comprehensive reply.	Amb,Male
10280	[[I]] would like to call on the [[Commissioner]], when she speaks, to give [[us]] a timetable for the early banning of any requirement to test finished products on [[animals]].	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
10281	The report by Mr [[Varela Suanzes-Carpegna]] contains a reference to the duty of the country under whose flag a vessel is flying to exercise jurisdiction and take action if that vessel infringes the regulations.	Male
10282	[[I]] congratulate Mr [[Virgin]] on his report and I fully share his thoughts and views.	Amb,Male
10283	I remember when I was a [[child]], if a radio or something got broken, it was sent to be repaired.	Amb
10284	It is simply amazing that the [[Commission]] is putting a proposal before [[us]] now before the studies of the [[population's]] potential intake of additives have been produced.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10285	Mrs [[Lalumière]], if that happens to [[me]] again, I would willingly engage you as my lawyer, because we must remember one thing, which was not mentioned here in the discussion, and my colleague Mr [[González Carnero]] has underlined it, that we must let caution rule in our relationship with Russia.	Female,Amb,Male
10286	As regards the vision of the future in economic terms, [[I]] go along with the description given by Mr [[Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra]] in his speech.	Amb,Male
10287	Was what your [[representative]] said in [[Committee]] wrong, when he said that the labelling directive would resolve the situation at some point?	Male,Amb
10288	[[I]] have to agree with the honourable [[Member]] I am well aware of her particular point of view and her very supportive attitude towards both the employment strategy and the preventive approach.	Amb,Female
10289	[[I]] ask those [[Members]] who support Mrs [[Roth's]] request to rise from their seats.	Amb,Amb,Female
10290	The Agenda, as [[we]] know, is currently only under discussion, and demands of this kind tend to dilute [[Parliament's]] actual intentions and are only grist to the mill of [[those]] who advocate subsidiarity, and who would accuse Brussels of stipulating the number of [[cows]] in the fields!	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
10291	To expect [[them]] to remain silent now is like asking the [[victim]] not to cry out so that his cries do not disturb the [[executioner]].	Amb,Male,Amb
10292	Fleeing [[Kosovars]] are being plucked from lorries by the dozen and in some cases the Member States assume their responsibilities and initiate asylum procedures.	Amb
10293	[[I]] should like to thank her for the work she has already done as the new [[Director]], and the [[Board]] of the Observatory, in particular [[Jean Kahn]], who is still recovering from a stroke, for the work they have done in its establishment.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
10294	Mr [[President]], Mrs [[McKenna]], [[I]] do not agree.	Male,Female,Amb
10295	His appearance in the European Parliament was not enough to reassure [[me]] that he would be the right [[person]] to lead the Commission during the next five-year term.	Amb,Male
10296	He was a determined and skilful [[Member]] of the Commission, a bit like a steam train, and occasionally in debates he would slap us [[MEPs]] like cod on a jetty, but what of that?	Male,Amb
10297	As the [[Member]] says, there are clearly quite a few questions being discussed and answered here today during the sitting, but there is relatively little information about these questions for the [[public]].	Amb,Amb
10298	Principal [[dancer]]	Amb
10299	Bogatyr-class [[cruisers]]	Amb
10300	If all these excuses are not enough then [[I]] want to dedicate this book to the [[child]] whom this [[grown-up]] once was.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10301	This visible relationship with the [[model]] brings the [[viewer]] of his pictures into a voyeur position.	Male,Amb
10302	Under the reigns of the sons of [[Meinhard II]], [[Otto]], [[Ludwig]] and [[Heinrich]] the Lords of Vilanders were finally able to secure their position and even to rise to higher social levels.	Amb,Male,Male,Male
10303	As a small [[child]], [[he]] occasionally played pranks on [[guests]].	Male,Male,Amb

10305	The first article in The New York Times that used hockey [[mom]] as a demographic term was a 1999 review of the Chevrolet Silverado, a full-size pickup truck.	Female

10310	From 1957 to 1977, [[Berganza]] was married to the composer and pianist [[Félix Lavilla]], with whom she recorded and performed regularly and with whom she has three [[children]], including soprano [[Cecilia Lavilla Berganza]].	Female,Amb,Female,Female
10311	Perfect singing and speaking technique, high musicality and an intensive acting expression made him an exceptional [[artist]].	Male

10313	Later, as an [[employee]] of the National Bureau of Standards, [[she]] was very active in the first two revisions of the Fortran language standard ("FORTRAN 77" and "Fortran 90").	Female,Female

10316	In several instances, a [[child]] was found in a camp who did resemble [[Elsie]], such that even [[Frank]] was momentarily certain it was his daughter and it would take some time to convince him it was a mistake.	Female,Female,Male
10317	While a [[student]], he worked as a paid intern for a biomedical [[company]], as a careers instructor in Cape Town, South Africa, and at Intuit on the TxtWeb project.	Male,Amb
10318	The opening school scene features class presentations by both the new [[Annie]], and a [[student]] representing her classic appearance, discussing aspects of and parallels between the economic states of the two settings, such as the New Deal and the modern lower class.	Female,Female
10319	In September 2016, in an interview with XBIZ [[White]] said she had moved to the United States and signed with Spiegler Girls to shoot for [[companies]] like Brazzers, Naughty America and Jules Jordan.	Female,Amb

10357	The next year, as the only Hmong [[member]] of the Opium Purchasing Board, [[he]] oversaw the institution of a new tax that was payable in opium for those [[farmers]] who were too poor to pay in cash.	Male,Male,Amb
10358	As regards other aspects of this subject, Mr [[President]], [[I]] would refer you to my written report.	Male,Amb
10359	The development of [[child]] sex tourism flies in the face of the very idea of a human [[community]] united on the basis of ideals such as respect and dignity, and public welfare and remembrance.	Amb,Amb
10360	The so-called two-stage information strategy, where [[peer groups]] keep each other' s [[members]] informed, has turned out to be the best of all options, and this should be put to good use too in dealing with this information issue.	Amb,Amb
10361	In most countries, the three stages of job organisation are not being respected. These stages are: the [[employer]] should adjust the working conditions and/or hours of the [[worker]] to avoid exposure to risk; if that fails, the worker should be moved to another job; only if neither option is possible should the worker be granted leave, as this reduces the worker' s income and also her career opportunities.	Amb,Female
10362	Mr [[President]], [[I]] voted in favour of the Conciliation [[Committee' s]] definitive decision on the directive on end-of-life vehicles. I voted in favour, not just because [[pensioners]] and elderly [[people]] who have reached a certain age feel that their fate is similar to that of cars, but, above all, because it is right and proper that, at last, thanks to Europe' s initiative, a solution has been found to the problem of where to put cars when they do not work any more.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10363	[[I]] should, moreover, like to pay tribute, at this point, to the rapporteur, Mrs [[Sudre]], for her open-mindedness and her consultative approach, which made it possible, with [[everyone]] joining forces, to successfully complete a report which offers our regions real hope.	Amb,Female,Amb
10364	(The [[President]] urged the [[speaker]] to bring her speech to a close) Mr President, I will conclude by saying that [[we]] are going to approve two amendments and another three will not be approved, as has been discussed in [[committee]].	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
10365	Our [[colleague]] over in the far corner of the House spoke earlier and quoted the Bible.	Amb
10366	[[I]] would like to thank Mrs [[Buitenweg]] for her report, which makes it clear that the margin for administrative expenditure is rather tight and that successful cooperation is therefore needed if [[we]] are to get by here in future.	Amb,Female,Amb
10367	[[Madam President]], [[I]] learned yesterday that the [[Bureau]] was to make a statement today about the memorandum being prepared by this [[House]] on enlargement.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
10368	A debate on a resolution on the Peruvian earthquake is not perhaps the most appropriate framework to discuss the political situation in Peru, but [[I]] would nevertheless like to stress that [[we]] are extremely satisfied with the capacity shown by Peru and its transitional [[government]] to carry out transparent and clean elections after the political disasters described very effectively by the honourable [[Member]] in his maiden speech.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male
10369	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] wish first to thank all [[those]] who have contributed to this White Paper giving European youth policy a new impetus, and in the production of which a unique consultation process has involved thousands of young [[Europeans]].	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
10370	Not with [[Arafat]]; not with any other [[leader]]; not today and not tomorrow.	Amb,Amb
10371	That is why the [[rapporteur]], the [[chairman]] of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the shadow [[rapporteurs]] meet regularly in order to represent Parliament to the Council, ask to be involved in negotiations and ensure that the Council's word and the word of the Spanish Presidency are respected by the Danish Presidency.	Amb,Male,Amb
10372	[[I]] should like to thank all [[those]] who have taken part, especially the individual [[Commissioners]], and Mrs [[Schreyer]] for being here all the time.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
10373	In the Likud, between [[Netanyahu]] and [[Sharon]], and in the Labour Party, in the middle of November, between three candidates, the former Defence Minister, the Mayor of Haifa and the former trade unionist - who was a Minister in the [[Rabin]] government - Mr [[Haim Ramon]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male
10374	This very substantial report from honourable [[Members]] recognises that practical reality and is a significant step towards the fulfilment of our commitments.	Amb
10375	[[I]] said that this should be complementary to all international conventions so as to ensure that there would be a level playing field and a comparable liability regime in that area too.	Amb
10376	Also, for the reason that [[you]] identify in your supplementary question, in these markets that [[we]] see in Scotland and in my home country of Ireland as well, [[herds]] arrive, they are sub-divided into other [[herds]], they are separated so that the chance of following a particular herd number and getting the information that you need in the case of an outbreak of disease is diluted to a considerable extent.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10377	The intention is good, but the means envisaged are not, particularly if [[one]] looks at them in the context of the broad economic orientations of the Member States of the European Union which, contrary to what the [[author]] of the report claims, are not reducing inequalities in Europe but are, on the contrary, helping to make them worse.	Amb,Amb
10378	On the Syria Association Agreement referred to by Mr [[Belder]], the agreement will help draw Syria into a more constructive engagement and will give [[us]] an opportunity to discuss the issues of mutual concern.	Male,Amb
10379	Mr [[President]], first of all [[I]] should like to say to the two [[Commissioners]] here – one of whom was in Cancún – how well and hard they worked to get a solution to the WTO negotiations.	Male,Amb,Amb
10380	The [[person]] responsible can then explain what he has done to apportion blame and to prevent any repetition.	Male
10381	Mr [[Louis]]	Male
10382	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to thank the [[Commissioner]] for Agriculture for what she has said. I would like to point out that banana production in the European Union is currently significant, that thousands of European Union [[families]] living in the outermost regions live from it and that, if banana production were to disappear, [[we]] would be abandoning some of Europe’s islands to their fate, despite the fact that, although they are far away, they are as European as the place from which I am speaking at this moment.	Male,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
10383	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to thank all of the [[members]] of the Committee on Petitions – a very important parliamentary committee – for their help, in particular its chairman, Mr [[Libicki]], and its vice-chairman, Mr [[Cashman]].	Male,Amb,Male,Male,Male
10384	Therefore, [[I]] am pleased to see that all of my [[colleagues]] show unanimous support for the abolition of the restrictions.	Amb,Amb
10385	[[I]] can tell you, Mr [[Vice-President]], that [[we]] even said that you could withdraw a proposal even following the [[Council’s]] Common Position if the Council turned the proposal into something it had not been, for it seems that, on two or three occasions, the Council adopted a resolution that was the precise opposite of what the [[Commission]] had intended to propose, and we were advised by the legal service that you would, in such a case, still have the right of withdrawal.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
10386	[[Poultry]] living in such conditions and fed in a natural manner will be more resistant to disease, and the meat produced will be healthier for [[humans]] than that obtained from mass-produced poultry, or in other words crowded flocks of [[birds]] that are fed an unvarying and unnatural diet and sometimes kept in very stressful conditions.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10387	All the EMSA can do is to support [[them]] and supplement what they do.	Amb
10388	There are also statistical connections, and [[I]] would thank the [[Commissioner]] for the extensive and detailed response to my written question.	Amb,Amb
10389	European law prohibits discrimination on the grounds of age, yet our [[Minister]] is openly discriminating against older quota [[owners]] in favour of young [[farmers]] to whom she wishes to give quota - and this is the key - at below market value.	Female,Amb,Amb
10390	The proposal to create the post of a European Foreign and Defence [[Minister]] is a threat to the interests of many Member States.	Amb
10391	It is a pity for Mr [[Jarzembowski]] and other German [[colleagues]], but it is good for road safety in Europe.	Male,Amb
10392	However, it should be borne in mind that the Schengen acquis also requires any [[person]] applying for a visa to justify the purpose of the travel and present supporting documents.	Amb
10393	Four years on, not a single [[patient]] has received a single drug.	Amb
10394	Let [[us]] recall the words of [[Angela Merkel]], and [[I]] quote - use different terminology without changing the legal substance, for example with regard to the title of the treaty, the denomination of legal acts, and the Union's [[minister]] of foreign affairs - end of quote.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10395	Mr [[President]], Madam [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], the short-term regional and international outlook before [[us]] presents a window of opportunity for a peaceful dynamic for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and setting up a Palestinian State, an opportunity which the international [[community]] cannot miss.	Male,Female,Female,Male,Amb,Amb
10396	What about [[passenger]] lists and Chapter 11 protection?	Amb
10397	[[I]] was putting questions to one of the country's senior [[figures]], who was responsible for what was happening there, and I said to him: 'You are not complying with international humanitarian law'.	Amb,Male
10398	[[rapporteur]]. - (PT) Mr [[President]], this oral amendment is supported by female [[Members]] from five political groups and also by one male [[Member]].	Amb,Male,Female,Male
10399	[[I]] therefore think that the rotating presidency will also have a clear role in the future, alongside the elected [[President]] who is being brought in via the new Treaty.	Amb,Amb
10400	in writing. - (PT) Although [[women]] represent around 4.5 to 5% of the prison population in the European Union, prisons continue to be geared basically towards male [[prisoners]] and tend to overlook the specific problem of the small but growing percentage of women prisoners.	Female,Male
10401	Moreover, [[women]] working in scientific research are paid much less than their male [[colleagues]] and their work usually consists more of teaching than of research, which seldom allows them to achieve recognition.	Female,Male
10402	in writing. - (PL) [[I]] should like to express my support for the report by Mr [[Grosch]] on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the common rules for access to the market for coach and bus services (recast).	Amb,Male
10403	Mr [[President]], to my colleague Mr [[Matsakis]] [[I]] would say that I live close to the Baltic; he does not.	Male,Male,Amb
10404	In some, [[teachers]] did not turn up and in one case a [[teacher]] made his [[students]] make tea for him all day long.	Amb,Male,Amb
10405	[[Patients]], too, are to have their rights in the internal market.	Amb
10406	[[I]] recently visited Elevate, a [[women's]] refuge in London, to talk to [[victims]] of domestic violence.	Amb,Female,Female
10407	[[Minister]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], right at the start of this budget debate, [[I]] must say that I would like not so much to cause an argument as to express my thanks.	Amb,Amb,Female,Male,Amb
10408	However, economic success must not be confused with social development, in [[society]] as in university; and so this crossroads [[we]] have come to in third-level education, with traditional [[student]]-based learning in one direction, and the demands of modern business-driven economies in the other, must be navigated with the greatest of care.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10409	Mr [[President]], [[I]] am sorry to inform you at this late hour that this afternoon a group of Estonian [[cyclists]] were kidnapped by armed [[men]] in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley.	Male,Amb,Amb,Male
10410	(BG) [[Madam President]], [[I]] would like to congratulate the [[rapporteur]] for his extremely diligent work on this report.	Female,Amb,Male
10411	(HU) Mr [[President]], numerous factors of equal importance guide the internal market.	Male
10412	In the case of Egypt, for example, the national [[committee]] formed to write the new constitution is composed only of [[men]], and even the new cabinet has only one female [[minister]].	Amb,Male,Female
10413	Lebanon is occupied by Syria, which has set up a puppet government - the government of the multi-millionaire [[Ariri]], the former friend and financier of [[Jacques Chirac]], whose inane comments and promises to the Lebanese [[people]] can now be seen for what they are.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10414	Fourth question, Madam [[Commissioner]]: why is it that the [[Commission]] is not carrying out an overall reform of the CAP which it has already admitted is needed by the year 2000 instead of taking these tiny measures on a piecemeal basis?	Female,Amb
10415	Today, the German press offers [[us]] an example of a case where equal rights were denied: a [[child]] with Down's Syndrome was not allowed to attend ordinary school, and the [[parents]] took legal action.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10416	[[I]] can only confirm what Mr [[White]] said.	Amb,Male
10417	[[I]] hope that the steps [[we]] are taking in Parliament today are quickly followed up by the Council, but I hope most of all that the opposition [[leader]] who is currently being held hostage will one day become president of her country, that the [[members]] of parliament who are in prison can one day take their seats, and that human rights will be respected.	Amb,Amb,Female,Amb
10418	In the letter by the Belarus [[Minister]] of Foreign Affairs, the first condition is, as [[I]] said, to discuss with all the [[deputies]] in the 13th Supreme Council, the current 'parliament' , the constitutional changes needed to establish a better separation of powers.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10419	One final point, if [[I]] may, Mr [[President]]: I would like to thank the [[Commissioner]] for the co-operative way in which she has worked with [[Parliament]] on the international agreements.	Amb,Male,Female,Amb
10420	Mrs [[Roth-Berendt]] was kind enough to say that [[I]] stand up for my views in issues like these, and that is what I am doing now.	Female,Amb
10421	Madam [[Minister]], Madam [[Commissioner]], [[we]] tabled two questions to prompt this debate, which is really intended to raise another strong warning from the European Parliament about the fight against organized crime, which [[everyone]] proclaims to be a priority, yet in practice little is done and what is done is not very effective.	Female,Female,Amb,Amb
10422	Firstly, in communications [[we're]] going to need both the printed word and electronic media to complement each other as forms of communication.	Amb
10423	And thanks also goes to Mr [[Samland]] for his excellent work as chairman of the [[committee]], and to Mr [[Liikanen]] for his cooperation as member of the Commission.	Male,Amb,Male
10424	From this point of view, the simplification aspects, that are taken into account in the Green Paper as one of the essential factors, have their own significance and [[I]] cannot fail to agree with the [[author]] of the question when he says that, from the point of view of the single market, it is to be hoped that tender proceedings will result in contracts being awarded to nonnational [[companies]] to an ever greater extent.	Amb,Male,Amb
10425	The National [[Assembly]], that had been elected at the elections on 16 March 1996, was dissolved and all authority was concentrated on the military [[junta]] in power.	Amb,Amb
10426	[[I]] would like to hear the [[Minister]] declare publicly that he is defending that position at the Industry Council.	Amb,Male
10427	Again [[I]] say to Mr [[Miranda]], I am not here to express views on behalf of the British [[Government]], I am here to express views on behalf of the [[Council]] and if he wishes to put a question to the British Government, as I said already to two of his [[colleagues]] then I am sure that the responsible [[minister]] would be able to give him a reply to the matters that he raises.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10428	Perhaps it might be wiser to think in terms of a [[chamber]] specialising in all fields of intellectual property, rather than a single [[judge]] system.	Amb,Amb
10429	On top of all this, there is the constant repression of [[women]]: for some time now women have been prohibited from being treated by male [[doctors]] and [[specialists]], when just 7 % of [[doctors]] in Iran are women.	Female,Male,Male,Female
10430	The [[Commission]] must have at its head a strong political [[figure]].	Amb,Amb
10431	[[I]] think [[anyone]] who believes that the social [[partners]] should decide for themselves [[whom]] they wish to appoint will vote in favour of it, and [[anyone]] who has a sort of paternalistic view of the social partners will of course vote against; they will do so in the context of the politically correct thinking observed on the other side of the House, and they will in fact be saying '[[we]] are going to decide exactly whom the social partners can appoint'.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10432	Madam [[President]], [[I]] thank Mrs [[Müller]] for her contribution.	Female,Amb,Female
10433	Will the [[Council]] undertake to keep the decision on the review and request the [[Commission]] to ensure that airports in Objective I areas and Objective I areas in transition are not penalised by the loss of revenue resulting from the ending of duty-free, which inevitably leads to higher prices for [[consumers]], loss of earnings for airlines, shipping [[companies]], ports and airports, and threatens employment for the industries and small [[firms]] which have supplied a range of goods to duty-free shops?	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb

10524	And so [[I]] would like to repeat my question as to whether the [[Council]] intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with Mr [[Kouchner]], who has a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today.	Amb,Amb,Male
10525	Deviating from the [[Council' s]] common position, the [[Committee]] on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water.	Amb,Amb
10526	The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0098/2000) by Mrs [[Palacio Vallelersundi]], on behalf of the [[Committee]] on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the communication from the [[Commission]] to the European Parliament and the [[Council]]: The Strategy for Europe' s Internal Market [COM(1999) 464 - C5-0212/1999 - 1999/2167(COS)]	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
10527	Madam [[President]], [[I]] would like to thank the [[Commissioner]] for her report, although a number of points seemed very unclear and could even be described as highly ambiguous.	Female,Amb,Female
10528	Mr [[President]], given the Cartesian evidence that this is not an issue falling within my area of responsibility, [[I]] can only say to the [[Member]] that I have noted her question and that, as usual, the [[Commission]] will certainly give her a direct answer.	Male,Amb,Female,Amb
10529	[[We]] also pay tribute to the French Presidency, in particular the [[minister]], for his determination to ensure that, in a very brief period of time, we truly learn the lessons of the Erika and make sure that they are applied to prevent an Erika-type disaster occurring again.	Amb,Male
10530	This has been disastrous for farming. Moreover, the [[rapporteur]], a member of the Conservative Party, must work within his own party to secure support for his proposals in the House of Commons.	Male
10531	Mr [[van Dam]] should go back and read my report because [[I]] neither criticised the [[Commission]] nor the [[fishermen]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
10532	The real issue today is to see how the [[Commission]] is going to follow up the work, which it asked an [[expert]] to carry out on this matter.	Amb,Amb
10533	When the [[rapporteur]] says that proofs of origin will guarantee transparency, that fits in very well with my repeated demand that the European [[institutions]] should set an example by being completely transparent for the benefit of the [[public]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
10534	Thirdly, as Mr [[Rothley]] pointed out earlier, the type of European [[company we]] are going to create is not going to provide any special advantage, above all any fiscal advantage; if we do not take action in the field of taxation, it is going to be very difficult to bring about the creation of European companies and, therefore, it seems to [[me]] very important, as the majority of previous [[speakers]] have proposed, that the fiscal field be involved.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
10535	Madame [[President]], [[I]], like many of my [[colleagues]], was very happy to see that after 30 years of negotiations and many false starts, [[we]] eventually had a compromise text on a European Company Statute.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
10536	Madam [[President]], in agreement with the [[rapporteur]] and the Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr [[Watson]], [[I]] would like to present an oral amendment to this compromise amendment, which would add a first sentence.	Female,Amb,Male,Amb
10537	Mr [[Morillon]], Mr [[Bowis]], Mr [[Posselt]] and Mr [[Gemelli]], on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, Mr [[Andrews]], on behalf of the UEN Group on the situation in Madagascar (B5-0289/2002);	Male,Male,Male,Male,Male
10538	Amendment No 13 on the opening of the [[assistant]] 1 to [[assistant]] 3 career bracket for specific duties including the duties of parliamentary [[ushers]]; Amendments Nos 9, 25, 48, 50 and 51 tabled by the [[rapporteurs]] relating to the status of the [[staff]] of the political [[groups]] - this means of course that the [[Commission]] cannot support Amendments Nos 32 and 60 which go well beyond the position set out wisely by the rapporteurs;	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10539	Madam [[President]], by virtue of the rules of the EC treaty, [[we]] on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs heard [[Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell]], the [[Council]]'[[s]] recommended candidate for the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, as successor to [[Sirkka Hämäläinen]].	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10540	Finally, on the Singapore issues: are you aware, [[Commissioner]], that on Thursday the DTI [[Minister]] in the UK said that she would be seeking a meeting with you on the Singapore issues to ensure that you stick to the position that was taken in Cancún and that [[we]] will no longer press for negotiations at the WTO on investment and competition?	Amb,Female,Amb
10541	In my country, it was not so long ago that only one female [[minister]] was appointed.	Female
10542	The draft resolution jointly proposed by the political [[groups]] is comprehensive and only needs implementing, which is the [[Commission’s]] responsibility.	Amb,Amb
10543	The debate will continue after the oral question on the financing of nature protection policy, so the debate on this item will resume at 4.00 p.m. and the first speaker will be Mrs [[Breyer]].	Female
10544	The report by Mr [[Costa]] on the Protocol to the Agreement on sea transport between the European Community and China in view of the accession of new countries is withdrawn from the agenda since [[Parliament]] has not yet been consulted.	Male,Amb
10545	[[I]] would also ask that this debate be conducted briskly and with dispatch, as Mr [[Trichet]] has already been waiting here for over an hour, and [[we]] do, I think, have more important things to do than going on in public about [[Members’]] private affairs.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
10546	However, [[we]] felt that the work of Europol was hugely valuable and that it is an effective organisation with a new [[director]] trying to invigorate the organisation.	Amb,Amb
10547	Particularly when it comes to [[child]] labour, [[we]] need to be sure about the situation regarding working conditions and public freedoms within developing countries.	Amb,Amb
10548	Currently, 58% of [[people]] with higher education qualifications in Europe are [[women]].	Female,Female
10549	. – Mr [[President]], thank you for making it possible for my intervention to be delayed until now; my apologies to the presidency of the Council, and to the [[Commissioner]], but [[I]] have come straight from a meeting of the Conference of [[Presidents]] with the [[President]] of Austria.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10550	[[I]] hope that today’s debate is the beginning of a process of close cooperation, sharing best practice between the institutions in a close partnership of equals, to build and restore that confidence that the [[doctor]] I mentioned was asking [[us]] to achieve for him as a consumer in the internal market.	Amb,Male,Amb
10551	With the German Presidency coming up, the [[Chancellor]] has clearly stated that she will set up a small group of [[officials]] to deal with a small group of [[officials]] in every country to identify where there are differences or difficulties.	Female,Amb,Amb
10552	on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr [[President]], Madam [[President-in-Office]] of the Council, Mr [[President of the Commission]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], as the President-in-Office of the Council said, we have to look to the future, and it is precisely that, [[I]] believe, that we have to do today - to look to the future, not only of the European Union, but also of Europe and of the world as a whole.	Male,Female,Male,Female,Male,Amb
10553	(ES) [[I]] would like to begin by congratulating the [[Commissioner]] on taking on her responsibility in relation to this issue.	Amb,Female
10554	[[Gordon Brown]] keeps on saying it is not a constitution, when all the EU [[leaders]] say it is: [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], [[José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero]], [[Angela Merkel]], even our own [[President]] of [[President]] said so in this Chamber a short while ago.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10555	[[author]]. - (NL) Mr [[President]], in assessing what is happening in and around Iran at the moment, there are four issues to be considered.	Amb,Male
10556	As [[Vice-Chairman]] of this Parliament with responsibility for the Neighbourhood Policy inter alia in Uzbekistan, I appeal to international [[institutions]], and particularly to the Uzbek [[authorities]], to take supporting action that leads to the development of a civil [[society]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
10557	With the adoption of this package, business and SMEs will find it easier, as Mr [[Stubb]] said, to sell their products - common household goods, bicycles, ladders, tanks, containers etc. - while [[consumers]] should reap the benefit of a wider choice of high-quality and safe products.

10559	Mr [[President]], my [[colleague]] has given the figures and [[I]] will not repeat them, except to say that, of the 57 000 figure he spoke of, 12 000 of those have gone to the Central African Republic since the beginning of 2008.	Male,Male,Amb
10560	In the 1990s, just as Mr [[Juncker]] says, [[we]] got mass unemployment, rising inflation and stagflation.	Male,Amb
10561	(IT) Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] would first like to point out that several months ago, outside a meeting of the World Trade Organisation steering [[committee]], of which I am a member, a [[colleague]] from Namibia expressed his disappointment that the prices of certain European agricultural and non-agricultural products in Namibia are lower in comparison with local products.

10563	[[I]] must say that these speeches by female [[Members]] are an expression of a new phase that is beginning in the European Union, also in the area of gender equality.	Amb,Female
10564	[[I]] can assure [[you]] that the [[Commission]] will back up action to improve the working conditions of precarious female [[workers]] by monitoring national employment policy and by providing structural fund support in particular.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
10565	His dying words were 'Thank God, [[I]] have done my duty'.	Male
10566	The [[legislators']] role is to adopt a law that will minimise the formalities involved in accessing [[doctors]] and allow [[citizens]] suffering from ill health to have a wide choice of medical services.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10567	[[We]] should be cutting our coat according to our cloth and, at precisely this point, we have no choice but to come to the unfortunate conclusion that this report by Mr [[Fernandes]] is something of a missed opportunity.	Amb,Male
10568	This is European law today: a national [[police]] force that tells [[people]] who have a residency permit issued by Italy: 'Mr [[Sarkozy]] has decided they do not count'.	Amb,Amb,Male
10569	In relation to my report, Baroness [[Ashton]], [[I]] would particularly like you to take note of paragraph 6, which calls for the drafting of a White Paper with a strategic focus on the European Union's role in international [[organisations]] through to 2020.	Female,Amb,Amb
10570	Ultimately, as Ms [[Merkies]] put it, [[we]] have to merge [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Steve Jobs]] and keep him or her in Europe: we must be seen to be attractive and dynamic, and unfettered by unnecessary red tape.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
10571	But [[I]] think, like Mrs [[Roth]], that [[we]] cannot make the subject of Chernobyl and the subject of the Middle East compete in the 'free market for news items' .	Amb,Female,Amb
10572	(The [[President]] urged the [[speaker]] to conclude) I am sorry, Mr President, but I am sure you, unlike the [[Council]], can allow a few moments for the [[disabled]] and less well-off in our society.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
10573	[[I]] also wish to thank the [[Commissioner]] for making his stand on this vital issue so clear today and two weeks ago when he came before the [[Committee]] on Social Affairs and Employment.	Amb,Male,Amb
10574	[[I]] therefore request that the vote be postponed to the next part-session, in January, so that all [[Members]] can be present and the debate can be given the weight and importance it deserves.	Amb,Amb
10575	(The [[President]] interrupted the [[speaker]]) I appeal to [[Members]] to keep their eyes open and to draw the [[public's]] attention to the shortcomings of the Charter.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10576	Madam [[Minister]], Madam [[Commissioner]], please give serious consideration to the results of this debate and vote.	Female,Female
10577	In the light of what the [[Commission]] has said in relation to Amendment No 3, where [[I]] think there was a genuine misapprehension, would Mr [[Virgin]] consider withdrawing it?	Amb,Amb,Male
10578	The [[Commission's]] proposal is unacceptable and the report presented by Mr [[Virgin]] admirably explains why.	Amb,Male
10579	To make further progress and combat violence against [[women]], more of our male [[colleagues]] ought to have shown solidarity by being present in the House during this debate.	Female,Male
10580	Madam [[President]], Mrs [[Junker]] says in her report that [[men]] must take greater responsibility for social and reproductive behaviour if [[we]] are to truly promote the aim of equality for [[women]] in developing countries and therefore it is right that the male [[Members]] of the European Parliament take part in this debate and support her excellent report to protest against the denial of adequate reproductive health facilities to [[women]] across the world.

10584	The report by our colleague Mr [[Virgin]] attempts to provide a satisfactory response to shipments of certain types of waste to non-OECD countries.	Male
10585	[[You]] only have to look at the European institutions themselves. Look at the number of women [[Commissioners]].	Amb,Female
10586	In the person of Mr [[Romano Prodi]] the [[Heads of State]] and Government have appointed a candidate for the office of President of the Commission who, [[I]] am firmly convinced, fulfils all the requirements for mastering these tasks together with [[us]] and with [[you]].

10679	Allow [[me]], however, to comment on the poor Council [[representative]] who will have to write up his protocol at some point: obviously the situation was awkward in Seoul due to the fact that some EU Member States have stopped exchanging [[ambassadors]] with North Korea and others have not.

10692	[[I]] should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the [[Commissioner]] on his openness with [[Parliament]] – that is a great attribute and very much appreciated by [[Members]] – as well as on his urgency and on the fact that he has not panicked.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
10693	Although there are different implementation models for the integration of gender equality strategy in the European Union (the dual family breadwinner model, the male breadwinner and female part-time [[worker]] and housewife model, the male breadwinner and female housewife model), gender equality is an important issue everywhere in the realm of employment – professional and vertical sex segregation in the labour market, linked to [[women]] culturally being allocated most responsibility for house work.

10707	Approximately 60% of all university [[graduates]] are women, and yet, there are barriers effectively stopping women from making the most of their potential.	Female
10708	Mrs [[Clinton]], too, in her letter acknowledged that [[Parliament]] had a point, but neither of these documents went further and gave [[us]] a blueprint for solving this problem, and that is why a 'no' will, in our view, push towards a better agreement for the whole Parliament.	Female,Amb,Amb
10709	[[I]] dream of a time when [[we]] can have a debate in this House and 50% of the [[speakers]] are [[men]] and 50% are [[women]].	Amb,Amb,Male,Male,Female
10710	This principle ensures that each legal system is represented within the [[Court]]; it is also a reflection of the collective guarantee system established by the Convention in which each contracting [[party]] is required to participate, and that means that [[we]] need a permanent full [[judge]] elected by the Union who enjoys the same status and has the same duties as his [[peers]] and who intervenes potentially in all cases.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
10711	The next item is the report by Mrs [[Jiménez-Becerril Barrio]] and Mrs [[Romero López]], on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the draft directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Protection Order (00002/2010 - C7-0006/2010 -.	Female,Female
10712	All of this is a milestone, a quantum leap forward in [[patient]] safety.	Amb
10713	[[I]] agree, in particular, with the attention paid by the [[rapporteur]] to female [[workers]], who are often discriminated against with regard to male [[workers]] where pensions are concerned.	Amb,Amb,Female,Male
10714	[[I]] have therefore offered to work with the [[rapporteur]] to ensure those savings are found.	Amb,Amb
10715	[[He]] has lost his life and [[we]] in this House have lost a [[friend]].	Male,Amb,Amb
10716	[[I]] received a telephone call yesterday from the British Agriculture [[Minister]] during which he informed me that he intended to come to Brussels next Tuesday and would present his proposals then.	Amb,Male
10717	At the same time, [[we]] must also point out that there was a certain ambivalence in that visit, because it was made in his capacity of French [[Head]] of [[State]], with all the weight that carries, but certainly not as the united voice of the European Community.	Amb,Male,Male
10718	Considering that one of the [[dead]] was also a Spanish [[citizen]], [[governments]] like [[mine]] have asked for immediate explanations and for [[those]] responsible to be brought to justice.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10719	[[I]] particularly have to draw the attention of Mr [[White]], who seems to be rather too privy to the discussions on the EPP, to the fact that [[we]] shall be opposing Amendment No 26.	Amb,Male,Amb
10720	Mr [[Fantuzzi]], it is Mr [[Collins]] who should ask for that.	Male,Male

10723	Madam [[President]], firstly, [[I]] would like to offer my congratulations to Mr [[Cunha]], who has worked with a great deal of enthusiasm on this report. To use a Dutch idiom: [[we]] had the impression that you 'felt like a fish in water'.	Female,Amb,Male,Amb
10724	Then the [[victim]] should be able to call upon this compensation [[body]] in his own country.	Male,Amb
10725	It is therefore essential to perfect the monitoring arrangements, but [[I]] do not believe, unlike the [[rapporteur]], that in order to do this [[we]] need to recruit an army of Community [[monitors]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10726	Examples of this could include murder cases, organised crime and drug trafficking and/or related hideous crimes.-The use of the Special Criminal Court recently for some drugs and organised crime cases has arisen as a result of the clarification of the powers of the [[Director]] of Public Prosecutions under the existing legalisation.	Amb
10727	My own opinion is that a sick [[athlete]] should be able to take whatever drugs the [[doctor]] prescribes to help him recover, whereas a healthy [[athlete]] should take nothing other than what is contained in a balanced diet.	Male,Amb,Amb

10817	The [[rapporteur]] has been very generous in his interpretation of the [[Council's]] inexplicable 8-month delay in responding to [[Parliament's]] six amendments during the first reading.	Male,Amb,Amb
10818	As the [[author]] is not present, Question No 14 lapses.	Amb
10819	Of course he is a German [[politician]], but the German Government is empowered and in a position to speak for Germany.	Male
10820	Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that all three [[people]] responsible - in the [[Commission]], Parliament and the Council - are women.	Female,Amb
10821	Mr [[President]], [[I]] share at least one certainty with the rapporteur, Mr [[Blokland]]: incineration may be a significant source of pollution but it is in fact necessary today, given the very low levels of waste recycling.	Male,Amb,Male
10822	Mr [[President]], the European Union's policy towards the countries of the Mediterranean is a far cry from the Barcelona Process and an even farther cry from the real needs of the [[people]] in these countries.	Male,Amb
10823	For the avoidance of all doubt, let [[me]] say that a [[public prosecutor]] of this kind could not, as the law currently stands, himself appear as a prosecutor in the national courts; his role would be to support and advise the relevant national public [[prosecutor's]] offices.	Amb,Male,Amb
10824	[[I]] would also like to thank Mrs [[Dean]] who, as Parliament official, has carried out much of the work on our behalf.	Amb,Female
10825	The United Kingdom seems to have adopted an attitude of quite excessive horror about public investment, and [[I]] noticed that in yesterday' s Guardian newspaper Mr [[Bob Kiley]], who ought to know, was predicting that the London Underground for which he is responsible, will, because of the [[Government' s]] insistance on the 'public-private investment partnership' whereby only private [[financiers]] are to come forward to invest, make the Tube worse and more expensive than it would have been under a programme of sensible public investment.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
10826	Mr [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], the right and the opportunity to live and work in other Member States of the European Union are important political aspirations for Europe' s [[citizens]].	Male,Amb,Female,Male,Amb
10827	Madam [[President]], [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], [[I]] too should first like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mr [[Harbour]].	Female,Amb,Female,Male,Amb,Male
10828	That emerged yet again in the attempted coup in the Central African Republic, in fact a classic scenario. A [[leader]] refuses to accept the outcome of the elections and does everything to regain power, supported by [[soldiers]] from his own ethnic [[group]] and this is followed by repression and cleansing operations.	Male,Amb,Amb
10829	Mr [[President]], dear [[friends]], [[I]] believe that Mrs [[Oomen-Ruijten's]] thoughts about the directive are correct, but I must vote against certain points in the report because they deal far too carelessly with the principle of subsidiarity.	Male,Amb,Amb,Female
10830	If a [[journalist]] is wrong, they will not be held responsible, unless he has touched money in the manipulation that has occurred.	Male
10831	It has to do with something that is a quite splendid addition to what has been achieved in terms of [[family]] and social policy - continued remuneration for one week in the year in the event of a [[person]] remaining at home to care for a close family member - perhaps a [[parent]] or [[grandparent]] - who has become ill.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10832	[[She]] claims she was raped by a [[friend]] and subsequently she bore a [[child]].	Female,Amb,Amb
10833	The Convention, Madam [[President]], must listen to the views of the majority of [[Europeans]] who, together with [[Parliament]], are calling for a return to effective multilateralism and to a Europe which is capable of taking action.	Female,Amb,Amb
10834	Regarding the ideological aspect, [[no one]] is taken in: this statute's primary objective is to detach the elected [[representative]] from his State of origin completely.	Amb,Male
10835	However, one thing must be clear to [[us]] all: models of [[employee]] part-ownership of productive wealth can only be implemented in practice if state incentives are provided.	Amb,Amb
10836	. – [[I]] am sure Mr [[Busquin]] would be more able to reply in more detail, but I shall make a general remark on how the Community research budget functions.	Amb,Male
10837	– Mr [[President]], [[I]] think that the time before the ICAO meeting at the end of September is the perfect moment for the European Parliament to speak its mind on the subject and for us – my dear Mr [[Schmitt]] – to discuss it.	Male,Amb,Male
10838	[[We]] need radical restructuring and to again make the [[citizen]] the centre of interest of the Union; we need a strategy that focuses on [[people]].	Amb,Amb,Amb
10839	Madam [[President]], ten years ago, the Iranian lyricist [[Said]] published a powerful literary diary entitled ‘The long arm of the mullahs, notes from my exile’.	Female,Amb
10840	[[I]] should like to ask the [[Minister]], in the spirit of Christmas, by wishing him well, if he does get that job at the airport, could he do something about direct flights to Strasbourg?	Amb,Male
10841	[[I]] am particularly grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs [[Korhola]], for her contribution to efforts to apply the Århus Convention to Community institutions.	Amb,Female
10842	Whilst these countries do not currently aspire to the Premiership, to be full [[members]], they are currently in the Championship and certainly not down at the bottom somewhere in the Conference League.	Amb
10843	[[I]] am sure my [[colleague]] will be very happy to discuss this issue with [[you]] once he has received the EFSA report.	Amb,Male,Amb
10844	[[I]] am aware that implementing it would involve a considerable amount of work for the [[Commission]], which is already limited in terms of financial and human resources	Amb,Amb
10845	(NL) Mr [[President]], [[I]] would also like to express my compliments to the rapporteur, Mrs [[Oomen-Ruijten]].	Male,Amb,Female
10846	Colonel [[Gaddafi]], on his website and in the full-page advert he placed in the Portuguese press in the final days of the EU-Africa Summit, attacked the Ottawa Convention and defended anti-[[personnel]] mines as the weapons of the [[poor]].	Male,Amb,Amb
10847	on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr [[President]], [[I]] too would like to thank the [[rapporteur]] for his work on this.	Male,Amb,Male
10848	[[author]]. - (HU) Thank [[you]] very much.	Amb,Amb
10849	She is a good [[person]] to work with and she understands many of the problems that [[I]] have with those elements of the Lisbon Treaty that are already being budgeted for, supposedly under the legal basis of financial perspectives agreed at Council - although I am pretty sure that is not correct.	Female,Amb
10850	[[draftsman]] of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (FI) Madam [[President]], [[Ministers]], [[Commissioners]], and Mrs [[Trautmann]] in particular, now is the time to think in actual terms of [[human]] rights in the information society, which [[we]] are improving, with democracy and good business practice as the main objectives.	Male,Female,Amb,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
10851	[[author]]. - Thank you, [[Commissioner]], for dealing with this question.	Amb,Amb
10852	As the head of a police authority, this [[minister]] should pack his bags and go.	Male
10853	If [[you]] look at the figures, [[we]] see, on average, 1 in 4 [[doctors]] and 1 [[nurse]] in 20 has trained in Africa and is working in OECD countries.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10854	In conclusion, [[I]] wish to thank the [[rapporteur]] for the excellent work he has done on this report.	Amb,Male
10855	There was a [[minister]] for agriculture who made a senseless comment that [[people]] should 'stop eating uncooked produce altogether', even though she had no authority for the matter.	Female,Amb
10856	[[I]] would like to ask the [[Commissioner]], first of all, whether he will respond to the question asked by Mr [[Leinen]] and Mrs [[Roth-Behrendt]], amongst [[others]], as to whether [[you]] will be bringing forward a truly European solution.	Amb,Male,Male,Female,Amb,Amb
10857	As regards education, the entitlement to education and the progress made, it is true that primary education for [[women]] is the key factor behind demographic change, but two-thirds of illiterate [[adults]] are women, and threequarters of [[children]] with no access to primary teaching are girls.	Female,Female,Female
10858	Firstly, what is the use of conferring a right if the [[person]] enjoying that right does not know he has it?	Male
10859	Mr [[President]], [[I]] naturally do not wish to question the faculties and powers of the [[Chair]], but it is my understanding that this [[House]], on matters which concern it as directly as voting or not voting, is sovereign, and if the House should decide by a majority of votes to hold the vote over, it could do so.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb
10860	And in this context, let [[me]] pay tribute to my [[colleague]], who wrote the report on marine safety which has been a textbook for what [[we]] are dealing with today.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10861	[[I]] would just like to say to the [[Member]] that there is, as she quite rightly says, a very close link between the consumption of alcohol and public health, and that is very much taken on board by our new framework programme.	Amb,Female
10862	(Applause) Furthermore, the fact that the British Agriculture Minister, Mr [[Hogg]], did not attend is an insult not just to Parliament, but to all the [[citizens]] of Europe.	Male,Amb
10863	The [[Committee]] of Inquiry has made an important contribution to the debate and in this regard [[we]] must congratulate the [[rapporteur]], the [[chairman]] and the [[members]] of the committee.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10864	This will undoubtedly not be our last debate on the subject, and [[we]] shall be holding further talks with Mr [[Tindemans]] and other [[colleagues]] in this context.	Amb,Male,Amb
10865	Mr [[President]], let [[me]] just say to the previous [[speaker]]: our amendments are not based on ideology but quite simply on facts that can be proven.	Male,Amb,Amb
10866	[[We]] need higher levels of employment, and by that [[I]] mean we need a change in fiscal legislation - which, as Mr [[Virgin]] mentioned, we have also debated this evening, and almost just as late at that - by shifting taxation away from the [[workforce]].	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
10867	[[I]] myself, along with my colleague Mrs [[Pack]], met with one of the [[prisoners]] before he began to serve his sentence in Skopje.	Amb,Female,Male
10868	[[Virgin]] recommendation (A4-0001/99)	Amb
10869	Mr [[President]], the first thing [[I]] want to say is how much I welcome what I hope will be the successful conclusion of this landmark agreement, and I congratulate the [[rapporteur]] for her tireless work to get the best possible outcome.	Male,Amb,Female
10870	It has just been revealed that the [[Minister]] for Agriculture from his party in the United Kingdom has not even been in dialogue with his opposite number in France, which is ridiculous when [[you]] consider the way tempers are getting raised in the process of this trade war.	Male,Amb
10871	[[Madam President]], the previous [[speaker]] finished by saying that nature and [[human beings]] are being exploited.	Female,Amb,Amb
10872	Some of the [[speakers]] - Mrs [[McKenna]] herself [[I]] believe - have referred to the crisis in the fishing industry.	Female,Female,Amb

10966	They always claim that they are the [[champions]] of the fight against the gravy train and here they are, in complete contradiction, asking for an extension of the scheme, which is totally unjustifiable, which will only benefit a few [[Members]] at enormous cost to the [[taxpayer]], and which will be extremely difficult to administer.	Amb,Amb,Amb

10971	It is true that this [[judge]] was basing his judgment on legislation adopted democratically and legitimately by over 90% of the Spanish Congress of [[Members]] and that, from that moment, your approach is defensible, but what is indefensible, not only from the point of view of the [[Spanish]], but also of [[Europeans]], is not condemning a very specific example of terrorism, that of ETA.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb

Male,Amb,Male,Female,Amb
10974	Her report is important for [[us]] not only because, if [[I]] am not mistaken, it is the first report drafted by a female Polish [[MEP]], but also because it concerns a particularly important issue, one that is crucial to the economic development of the European Union.	Amb,Amb,Female
10975	Commissioner [[Dimas]] has already highlighted a number of measures that have been taken.	Amb

10977	There are six references, seven recitals and twelve articles in this text on the Palestinian election result, and not once do [[they]] manage to mention – even mention – [[Hamas]] and the Charter of hate underpinning its ideology and its action.	Amb,Amb

10983	[[We]] will soon have the Communication from the European Commission on the CAP 'health check' on the table, but [[I]] fear that in that communication the Community [[executive]] will not be bold enough to acknowledge that the liberalisation of the markets also has a price, and that European [[farmers]] and [[consumers]] are now starting to pay that price.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
10984	To achieve this, as Mr [[Albertini]] says in his report, [[we]] need innovative measures and instruments.	Male,Amb

10987	ASEAN is an extremely diverse region with three of its [[members]] being LDCs, while [[others]] have a higher income per [[head]] than many EU Member States.	Amb,Amb,Amb
10988	It is the [[claims representative's]] duty to inform the [[victim]] how to pursue his claim against a foreign [[national]], and it would increase consumer confidence if the information package accessible before conclusion of the insurance contract included full information on the rules governing the functioning and application of the claims representative system and its benefits for the victim.	Amb,Male,Amb
10989	[[We]] must provide political assistance to the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to enable it to help itself and its [[citizens]].	Amb,Amb

10993	As regards the last fifteen years, I can give [[you]] my own assurance, having been personally involved in my capacity as a [[member]] of the OSCE and otherwise.	Amb,Amb

11001	In relation to the question that the honourable [[Member]] has asked, as she will be aware, a joint action is an enabling statutory procedure under the Treaties, specifically the second and third pillars as provided for in the Treaty on European Union.	Female
11002	[[We]] have reached a point where a [[Minister]] of the self-styled Turkish Cypriot government - the Minister for Agriculture - himself became the murderer of [[Solomos]], who like [[Isaac]] after all, was doing nothing more than calling for the restoration of legality to that long-suffering island.	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb

11004	The [[Commissioner]] says he agrees with the amendments, but he does nothing further.	Male

11006	[[I]] admire the courage of my [[colleague]] in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in talking about it, but saying so little also produces mistakes and therefore both I and the Committee on the Environment consider this part wrong.	Amb,Amb
11007	Surely it cannot be left to the discretion of Mr [[Hogg]], the Minister of Agriculture, whether he justifies his actions to the BSE [[Committee]] or not.	Male,Amb
11008	[[We]] shall give our complete and full support to the amendments Mr [[Virgin]] has tabled, as an attempt to arrive at a conclusion by objective argument.	Amb,Male
11009	As the [[author]] is not present, Question No 36 falls.	Amb
11010	[[I]] think he was called as a [[supporter]], however.	Amb,Male
11011	The [[Commission]] has made enquiries about the matters raised by the honourable [[Member]] in her question and [[I]] have to report to the [[House]] that [[we]] have not been able to find any evidence of any communication by the French [[government]] to the effect that British road [[hauliers]] would not be compensated following the 1997 strike action by French road transport [[workers]].	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
11012	In fact, one and a half years ago, the French [[Minister]] for Foreign Affairs said that he believed [[Mobutu]] was the only one who could guarantee Zaire's territorial integrity.	Male,Amb
11013	If there are differences between the training provided in the Member State of origin and in the host Member State, the migrant [[worker]] must prove that he has acquired the additional knowledge through an updating course or an aptitude test.	Male

11108	[[I]] feel that this document is extremely important, and it is crucial that Mrs [[Hermange]] has stressed that illiteracy does not just mean not knowing how to read and write, but not understanding discussions and being unable to move about in modern [[society]], where it is not enough to know how to read and write but where a certain culture and savoir-faire are necessary for a [[person]] to have any status.

11120	Finally, [[I]] am asking for a clear response from the [[Commissioner]] to the suggestion to create a separate Directorate-General for accounting and combating fraud with effect from 2005, to bring to an end once and for all the merging of responsibilities in the present Directorate-General for the Budget.

11132	On a similar theme, the industry is keen for the choice of [[executive director]] to be based on objective criteria of experience and technical knowledge, rather than on political criteria.	Amb
11133	For years, [[I]] have been warning of [[managers]] who have lost touch with reality, such as Mr [[Forgeat]], who, [[you]] will recall, walked away with suitcases full of millions of euros and who, for one, had no doubts about prices and deadlines.	Amb,Male,Male,Amb

11143	[[Member]] of the [[Commission]]. - Madam [[President]], first to Mr [[Leinen]], I think it is a very good idea that, whenever [[delegations]] do go out, you have the time and priority also to get climate on the agenda.	Amb,Amb,Female,Male,Amb

Amb,Amb,Amb,Male
11146	As the [[rapporteur]] makes very explicit in his explanatory statement, this change constitutes an opportunity, but it is also a larger challenge to the proper utilisation of this instrument, which could lose in consistency that which it gains in scope.	Male

11155	Things improved with the new [[leader]] in Mitsos.	Amb
11156	For that reason, [[I]] think the European elections should use the autonomous constituencies, since this method brings the [[Member]] closer to the [[people]] he represents, and makes him more accessible, thereby achieving one of our objectives: that the European Parliament be more sensitive to the needs and concerns of all European [[citizens]].	Amb,Male,Amb,Amb
11157	[[I]] should like to hear what the [[Commissioner]] has to say about the voluntary agreement she has secured here with the automobile industry concerning CO2 .	Amb,Female
11158	It is not what the honourable [[Member]] heard and [[I]] am sorry that either through her conviction or as a result of a problem of interpretation she thought she heard what she did not hear and what was not said.	Female,Amb
11159	In conclusion, therefore, [[I]] should like to join with the previous [[speakers]] in calling on the Community institutions and the European Commission to play a more effective role in this area. Unfortunately, although the launch of the euro is now almost upon [[us]], they are not yet making their presence felt in the international financial institutions.	Amb,Amb,Amb
11160	Even if [[I]] do not always agree with him, and there are indeed a number of points in his report that I do not agree with, I would be the first to acknowledge that he is a [[person]] who is extremely serious and most courteous in his work.	Amb,Male

11242	Mr [[President]], [[I]] should like to follow on from what Mrs [[Lulling]] has just said.	Male,Amb,Female
11243	The Spanish journalist, [[Carlos Herrera]], is a symbol of all those [[victims]], Madam [[President]], and [[I]] would like to ask you, on behalf of the European Parliament, to convey to him our feeling of solidarity, because this solidarity expresses the unquestionable defence of freedom of expression that we, as [[democrats]], are obliged to make.	Male,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
11244	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to start off by congratulating Mr [[Ferber]] on excellent guidelines. I welcome the clear orientation of the report to planning for enlargement.	Male,Amb,Male
11245	In addition, it is very important to organise better cooperation between Member States [[police forces]] through Europol.	Amb
11246	Once again [[I]] thank the honourable [[Member]] for her superb report.	Amb,Female

11248	A penalty also involves respect for the [[victim]].	Amb
11249	The majority of our [[group]] can essentially concur with the minority opinion, expressed by Mr [[Ribeiro e Castro]], to the effect that what we have here is a warped view of democracy.	Amb,Male

11255	Mr [[President]], [[I]] wish firstly to thank the [[MEPs]] for their interest in this proposal, and I naturally want to convey special thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs [[Ries]], for her constructive work.	Male,Amb,Amb,Female
11256	As one [[speaker]] has just reminded [[us]], this progress has given the Union and third countries the technical parameters needed in order to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. As [[you]] know, the Council of [[Ministers]] of the Union took the decision to ratify the protocol at the beginning of March and we shall all do our best to ensure that the ratification acts are filed by 1 June, i.e. before the world summit on sustainable development, as a symbol of the leadership which the Union has demonstrated here and in the run-up to the Johannesburg summit.	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
11257	[[I]] simply wished to thank the [[Commissioner]] for his answers, for his words, and to say that I did not for a moment think that Mr [[Schmidt's]] dismissal had anything to do with the delay in the proposals for reform.	Amb,Male,Male
11258	[[I]] can assure [[you]] that a film [[director]] from a third country could not show his or her film in Europe without an invitation to a European cinema festival.	Amb,Amb,Amb
11259	Nevertheless, our anti-war position does not mean siding with that regime, which must account for its crimes before international [[courts]], and it does not mean being indifferent to the dangerous path being opened up by the violation of international law and the many other violations, such as the use of prohibited weapons, the suffering inflicted on the Iraqi [[people]], the treatment of [[prisoners]] and the fate of the Kurdish [[people]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
11260	The Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly also holds that the potential conflict of interest between the holding of political office by Mr [[Berlusconi]] and his private economic and media interests is a threat to media pluralism.	Male
11261	[[I]] myself have come to realise, whilst expecting my first [[child]], how hard it has been to combine motherhood with the career of a [[Member]] of Parliament.	Female,Amb,Amb
11262	Mr [[President]], [[I]] can allay the fears of [[colleagues]]: Mrs [[Frassoni]] was mixing up [[committees]] of inquiry and temporary [[committees]].	Male,Amb,Amb,Female,Amb,Amb
11263	[[I]] congratulate Mr [[Goodwill]], who has written a good report and taken on board many of the comments and remarks made by [[colleagues]].	Amb,Male,Amb
11264	As Mr [[Graça Moura]] and Mr [[Crowley]] mentioned, spiritual and architectural heritage and the human dimension should be taken into account.	Male,Male
11265	According to estimates of GDP per [[head]] of [[population]], it is likely that in the seven years between 2014 and 2020 Mazowsze will exceed 75% of the average GDP per head of population for the European Union, and will no longer qualify for support from the Structural Funds.	Amb,Amb
11266	[[You]] are used to playing a tough game. Half of your [[ministers]] are women.	Amb,Female
11267	[[I]] would like to thank Mrs [[Jöns]] once more for her excellent work.	Amb,Female
11268	[[Member]] of the [[Commission]]. - (FR) [[You]] are probably right, but I just had the opportunity to deal with this issue of rural development only recently.	Amb,Amb,Amb
11269	From the point of view of implementation of common policies, there is no reason why the EU [[institutions]] should have access to data on the number of marriages and [[partners]] of each female [[citizen]] or the length of these relationships.	Amb,Female,Female
11270	[[She]] said, 'I want to build a Pakistan where a [[Jew]] can go to the synagogue, a [[Christian]] to the church and a [[Muslim]] to the mosque, all without any fear'.	Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
11271	[[Ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], this is a wonderful day for the European Parliament, and that is because [[we]] are welcoming one of our former fellow [[Members]] here - one who is now President of the Republic of Estonia, our former fellow Member Mr [[Hendrik Ilves]]!	Female,Male,Amb,Male,Male
11272	Some [[experts]] tell [[me]] that [[we]] could also reduce the oil price just with this measure.	Amb,Amb,Amb
11273	As Mrs [[Napoletano]] has also said, [[we]] are not giving enough money, because we are keen on an outcome that resolves the crisis and ends insecurity.	Female,Amb
11274	Promotion in the scientific world depends on academic achievement, and a [[woman's]] chance of being appointed to a [[Chair]] is three times lower than that of a [[man]].	Female,Amb,Male
11275	The EU's role is to facilitate various school exchanges and expedite [[student]] mobility And it should not involve itself in any other school-related matters.	Amb
11276	The [[director]] will appear before the relevant [[committee]] of this House, both prior to appointment and during his or her term of office, to make a statement and answer questions.	Amb,Amb
11277	Sadly, the refusal of the regime to allow our socialist [[colleague]] to enter Cuba because he wanted to contact the opposition is not a sign of real change.	Male
11278	And it is also balanced in terms of its representation of the genders, given that one third of its [[members]] are female, a small increase in comparison to before.	Female
11279	Just last month in his statement during the High-Level Event on Biodiversity at the United Nations General Assembly, President [[Barroso]] remarked that our ability to end poverty and hunger and improve [[child]] and maternal health depends on the long-term availability of fresh water, food, medicine and raw materials that nature provides.	Male,Amb
11280	This is something that will be required in future thanks to the directive that Mrs [[Muscardini]] has so efficiently prepared.	Female
11281	The floods that took place in November 2009 seriously affected Ireland and caused severe damage estimated at more than EUR 520 million. [[I]] therefore believe that the mobilisation of the fund is fully justified in order to help [[those]] who have suffered most from this natural disaster, and I congratulate the [[chair]] of the Committee on Regional Development for the speed with which she issued its opinion, thereby avoiding undue delays in the parliamentary procedure.	Amb,Amb,Female
11282	Action point for Europe: bring about the release of this [[minister]] and end permanent state surveillance of house churches in the Islamic Republic.	Amb
11283	Mr [[President]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], other than the [[Commission]], [[I]] should also certainly like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Culture and Education, Mrs [[Pack]], for the work and dedication that she has lavished on this dossier.	Male,Female,Male,Amb,Amb,Female
11284	Mr [[President]], [[Shahbaz Bhatti]] and all his [[family]] are an astonishing example of what brave, principled, loyal [[people]] can achieve.	Male,Male,Amb,Amb
11285	on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr [[President]], [[I]] have here the letter from the [[representative]] of Her [[Majesty's]] Government on the SURE report.	Male,Amb,Female,Female
11286	Although the first Conference of [[donors]] on 20 and 21 December 1995 took place hurriedly and at some distance from our Assembly, the next, on 12 and 13 April in Brussels, gave it a substantial role as Mrs [[Müller]], Mr [[Mendiluce]], Mr [[Titley]] and [[I]] represented [[you]] there.	Amb,Female,Male,Male,Amb,Amb
11287	Mrs [[Riis-Jørgensen]] makes the point in support of giving it a different number that [[consumers]] are going to be confused.	Female,Amb
11288	And when their numbers reached 3500 and Mr [[Metten]] was getting nervous, something had to be done.	Male
11289	Given this attitude of mutual support, therefore - because the problem remains - [[I]] would be most grateful if [[you]] would give a copy to [[Parliament]] and to this [[Member]] in particular - so that Parliament and European public opinion in general might be informed - of the letter you sent to the French [[minister]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
11290	As the [[draftsman]] of the REX [[Committee]], I have taken a look at the draft regulation and, like Mr [[Virgin]], I could only shake my head at some of the points proposed there.	Male,Amb,Male
11291	[[They]] were convicted even through the action got the Finnish Agriculture [[Minister]] to close the fish farm.	Amb,Amb
11292	Finally, and this should concern [[everyone]] in this House, even if they are far from the sea, it will undermine support for the European Union and give added fuel to [[those]] who say there is only one way out of this desperate Common Fisheries Policy and that is to leave the European Union.	Amb,Amb
11293	Mr [[Izquierdo Collado]] is in his report setting out a number of priorities, which [[I]] subscribe to overall.	Male,Amb
11294	And thirdly, and most importantly, the perspective of the future, since if [[we]] do not know where we are going, we will recognize neither our new point of departure nor the road itself - to which Mr [[Méndez de Vigo]] referred this morning.	Amb,Male
11295	Mr [[President]], Mr [[Commissioner]], [[ladies]] and [[gentlemen]], the [[Committee]] on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs targeted and concentrated all its discussions and then its final opinion on enlargement towards the creation of an extended area of freedom, security and law.	Male,Male,Female,Male,Amb
11296	But [[I]] cannot understand the [[Commission]] and the [[Council]] not accepting these logically convincing amendments, which were accepted by a clear majority in Parliament and which really - as my [[colleague]] said - correspond to the interests of female [[citizens]].	Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb,Female
11297	[[I]] should like to ask the [[Commissioner]] whether he accepts the legitimacy of the 1990 elections in Burma in which the NLD led by [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] were the clear and legitimate winners.	Amb,Male,Amb
11298	And that is what [[I]] want the [[Commissioner]] to think about with [[us]], although the idea is not new to her. I would like her to consider the extent to which the European Commission is prepared to sit down at the table with these [[operators]], as one of their most important customers, and make them bring their prices down to realistic levels which will allow demand to increase, and will give easy access to [[everybody]], no matter which European region they happen to be in.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
11299	And on 19 November this [[Parliament]] gave a few recipes, in its statement on the Treaty of Amsterdam, which Mrs [[Green]] reminded [[you]] of today. In order to have an effective Europe, the [[Commission]] will have to be strengthened, codecision and the qualified majority will have to be extended, and there will have to be a re-weighting of [[Council]] votes.	Amb,Female,Amb,Amb,Amb
11300	The [[rapporteur]] thought that these amendments were correct. In particular, he prefers his own amendment, number 14, but any of these appears to improve the situation so as not to cause a confrontation between the island of Réunion and the French department of Guiana.	Male
11301	This [[unit]] should supervise the appropriate quality control as well as comparing results from internal assessment, being involved in improving the exchange of experiences, not only in the heart of the [[Committee]] but also with other [[institutes]] responsible for development aid.	Amb,Amb,Amb
11302	The draft report by Mr [[Collins]] has taken over one of the three amendments tabled by the [[Committee]] on Budgets, the one on Article 1(6).	Male,Amb
11303	[[I]] cannot give a specific answer to the point the honourable [[Member]] has made because, in fact, the outcome of those discussions is being considered and my [[colleague]] will be making a statement in a debate on Thursday at which I have little doubt he will convey the outcome of the meeting, the conclusions the [[Commission]] has drawn and the action that has been taken.	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
11304	Thanks to these new measures [[we]] are going to vote for, a [[victim]] living in another country will now be able to defend his interests through his own consumer organization.	Amb,Male
11305	Mr [[President-in-Office]] of the Council, [[I]] appeal to you and I am counting on it and I think that the whole [[Parliament]] is counting on it, that the resolution that [[we]] adopted here two days ago will also be adopted by the Council today or tomorrow, so that a single [[candidate]] will be appointed to the presidency of the European Central Bank.	Male,Amb,Amb,Amb,Amb
11306	That is why the [[Commission]] considers it very important that [[we]] begin by collecting and collating the information in order, as Mr [[Virgin]] just said, to establish a kind of benchmarking for the various systems, so as to identify where there are better options that can perhaps be recommended to [[others]].	Amb,Amb,Male,Amb
11307	Mr [[Heaton-Harris]], if you have doubts about what [[I]] announced then you must ask for an electronic confirmation of the outcome of the vote, as other [[Members]] do when they have doubts. It is quite simple.	Male,Amb,Amb
11308	Mr [[President]], [[I]] would like to add just two points to the comments made by Mr [[Morillon]], Mr [[Cohn-Bendit]], Mr [[Posselt]] and Mr [[Schori]], which I completely endorse.	Male,Amb,Male,Male,Male,Male
